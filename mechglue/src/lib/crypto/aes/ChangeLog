	* Makefile.in (aes-gen): Use CC_LINK.  Reported by Mike Friedman.

2005-04-13  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

	* aesopt.h: On PalmOS, include FloatMgr.h to get endianness flag.
	(ENC_UNROLL, DEC_UNROLL, ENC_ROUND, LAST_ENC_ROUND, DEC_ROUND,
	LAST_DEC_ROUND, KEY_SCHED): If CONFIG_SMALL is defined, set to
	NONE or NO_TABLES as appropriate.

	* aes_s2k.c (krb5int_aes_string_to_key): Widen bytes of iteration
	count before shifting.

	* Makefile.in (all-unix): Don't build aes-gen by default, leave it
	for 'make check'.

2004-09-28  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

	* vbaxam.doc: File deleted.

2004-05-25  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* aesopt.h (PLATFORM_BYTE_ORDER): Treat _WIN32 as always
	little-endian.  Default to little-endian if there's no other
	compile-time way to detect endianness, noting it as a guess.
	(SAFE_IO): Error out if SAFE_IO is not set and endianness was
	guessed.

2004-05-13  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in (aes-test): Link test program against thread support
	library.

2004-05-07  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

	* aesopt.h (PLATFORM_BYTE_ORDER): Check for _MIPSEB, _MIPSEL.  If
	endian.h or machine/endian.h is available, include it instead of
	sys/param.h.  Don't mess around with multibyte character
	constants.

2003-07-17  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in (LIBNAME) [##WIN16##]: Don't define.

2003-05-13  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

	* aes_s2k.c (DEFAULT_ITERATION_COUNT): New macro; define to 4096.
	(MAX_ITERATION_COUNT): New macro.
	(krb5int_aes_string_to_key): Use them.

2003-04-29  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

	* uitypes.h: Use inttypes.h if HAVE_INTTYPES_H is defined.

2003-04-13  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

	* aes_s2k.c (krb5int_aes_string_to_key): Return an error if the
	supplied iteration count is really, really large.

2003-03-04  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

	* aes_s2k.c, aes_s2k.h: New files.
	* Makefile.in (STLIBOBJS, OBJS, SRCS): Build aes_s2k.
	(LOCALINCLUDES): Add dk directory.
	(GEN_OBJS): New variable.
	(aes-gen): Use GEN_OBJS.

2003-02-28  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@bu.edu>

	* Makefile.in (clean): Cleanup testing objects and outputs

2003-02-05  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@.bu.edu>

	* Makefile.in (run-aes-test): Add $(RUN_SETUP) so that if
	compiling only shared libraries, LD_LIBRARY_PATH is set for test.

2003-02-03  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

	* New directory, with Briad Gladstone's implementation of AES,
	tweaked for the MIT krb5 build system.
