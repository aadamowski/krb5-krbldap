Contained herein are:

- trunk: trunk copy with various developmental and debugging code
- ptest.c: hacked up version of kvno instrumented for
  various debugging purposes (takes a hostname as a single arg)
- Makefile: builds ptest, krb5 src, etags, etc.
- setup.sh: script to use the pre-install build environment artifacts
  for testing purposes

The trunk may be of interest.  It's doubtful whether the rest is.  The
ptest code in particular is all hacked up and may or may not have
relevance or functionality at any given time.
