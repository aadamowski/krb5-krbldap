		  Kerberos Version 5, Release 1.2.2

			    Release Notes

			The MIT Kerberos Team

Unpacking the Source Distribution
---------------------------------

The source distribution of Kerberos 5 comes in a gzipped tarfile,
krb5-1.2.2.tar.gz.  Instruction on how to extract the entire
distribution follow.  These directions assume that you want to extract
into a directory called DIST.

If you have the GNU tar program and gzip installed, you can simply do:

	mkdir DIST
	cd DIST
	gtar zxpf krb5-1.2.2.tar.gz

If you don't have GNU tar, you will need to get the FSF gzip
distribution and use gzcat:

	mkdir DIST
	cd DIST
	gzcat krb5-1.2.2.tar.gz | tar xpf -

Both of these methods will extract the sources into DIST/krb5-1.2.2/src
and the documentation into DIST/krb5-1.2.2/doc.

Building and Installing Kerberos 5
----------------------------------

The first file you should look at is doc/install.ps; it contains the
notes for building and installing Kerberos 5.  The info file
krb5-install.info has the same information in info file format.  You
can view this using the GNU emacs info-mode, or by using the
standalone info file viewer from the Free Software Foundation.  This
is also available as an HTML file, install.html.

Other good files to look at are admin-guide.ps and user-guide.ps,
which contain the system administrator's guide, and the user's guide,
respectively.  They are also available as info files
kerberos-admin.info and krb5-user.info, respectively.  These files are
also available as HTML files.

If you are attempting to build under Windows, please see the
src/windows/README file.

Reporting Bugs
--------------

Please report any problems/bugs/comments using the krb5-send-pr
program.  The krb5-send-pr program will be installed in the sbin
directory once you have successfully compiled and installed Kerberos
V5 (or if you have installed one of our binary distributions).

If you are not able to use krb5-send-pr because you haven't been able
compile and install Kerberos V5 on any platform, you may send mail to
krb5-bugs@mit.edu.

Notes, Major Changes, and Known Bugs for 1.2.2
----------------------------------------------

Notes:

* This release is a patch release; some non-critical bugs and feature
  requests have not been incorporated.

Major Changes:

* The KDC dump format has been updated to include per-principal policy
  information.  This will require updating your slave KDCs before your
  master if you want things to still work. [XXX add to admin doc]

* A library bug that prevented kprop from working properly with DES3
  keys has been fixed.

* kpasswd should no longer coredump when there is no kadmin_server
  line in krb5.conf.

* ASN.1 parsing has been improved to deal with indefinite encodings,
  such as those emitted by DCE-1.0 derived systems.

* Preauthentication handling code in the initial ticket APIs has been
  fixed to handle zero-length ETYPE_INFO sequences without causing a
  NULL pointer dereference.

* The replay cache should no longer leak temporary files.  Related
  hard-to-analyze filename bugs in the rcache code should also be
  fixed.

* Library builds should now work on AIX.

* KDC local address search code should now work on AIX.

* The yacc grammar for the ftp daemon has been modified to be
  compilable on HP/UX with Bison; namespace pollution from system
  headers was causing trouble before.

Known Bugs:

* The gss-sample test application suite is known to not communicate
  with the gss-sample suite in 1.1.x and earlier releases.  This is
  the result of changes to increase functionality; fixes to allow for
  backwards compatibility will occur in a later release.

* Handling of utmp and utmpx updates is known to be broken on some
  systems, such as Solaris 8.  We are investigating possible solutions
  to this problem.

* Tru64 Unix 5.0 (aka OSF/1 5.0), at least, has some problems with
  revoke() returning ENOTTY in open_slave in the pty library.  One
  possible workaround is to insert

	vfs:
		revoke_tty_only = 0

  in /etc/sysconfigtab.  It is not known whether this workaround will
  cause other problems.

Notes, Major Changes, and Known Bugs for 1.2.1 and 1.2
------------------------------------------------------

* Triple DES support, for session keys as well as user or service
  keys, should be nearly complete in this release.  Much of the work
  that has been needed is generic multiple-cryptosystem support, so
  the addition of another cryptosystem should be much easier.

  * GSSAPI support for 3DES has been added.  An Internet Draft is
    being worked on that will describe how this works; it is not
    currently standardized.  Some backwards-compatibility issues in
    this area mean that enabling 3DES support must be done with
    caution; service keys that are used for GSSAPI must not be updated
    to 3DES until the services themselves are upgraded to support 3DES
    under GSSAPI.

* DNS support for locating KDCs is enabled by default.  DNS support
  for looking up the realm of a host is compiled in but disabled by
  default (due to some concerns with DNS spoofing).

  We recommend that you publish your KDC information through DNS even
  if you intend to rely on config files at your own site; otherwise,
  sites that wish to communicate with you will have to keep their
  config files updated with your information.  One of the goals of
  this code is to reduce the client-side configuration maintenance
  requirements as much as is possible, without compromising security.

  See the administrator's guide for information on setting up DNS
  information for your realm.

  One important effect of this for developers is that on many systems,
  "-lresolv" must be added to the compiler command line when linking
  Kerberos programs.

  Configure-time options are available to control the inclusion of the
  DNS code and the setting of the defaults.  Entries in krb5.conf will
  also modify the behavior if the code has been compiled in.

* Numerous buffer-overrun problems have been found and fixed.  Many of
  these were in locations we don't expect can be exploited in any
  useful way (for example, overrunning a buffer of MAXPATHLEN bytes if
  a compiled-in pathname is too long, in a program that has no special
  privileges).  It may be possible to exploit a few of these to
  compromise system security.

* Partial support for IPv6 addresses has been added.  It can be
  enabled or disabled at configure time with --enable-ipv6 or
  --disable-ipv6; by default, the configure script will search for
  certain types and macros, and enable the IPv6 code if they're found.
  The IPv6 support at this time mostly consists of including the
  addresses in credentials.

* A protocol change has been made to the "rcmd" suite (rlogin, rsh,
  rcp) to address several security problems described in Kris
  Hildrum's paper presented at NDSS 2000.  New command-line options
  have been added to control the selection of protocol, since the
  revised protocol is not compatible with the old one.

* A security problem in login.krb5 has been fixed.  This problem was
  only present if the krb4 compatibility code was not compiled in.

* A security problem with ftpd has been fixed.  An error in the in the
  yacc grammar permitted potential root access.

* The client programs kinit, klist and kdestroy have been changed to
  incorporate krb4 support.  New command-line options control whether
  krb4 behavior, krb5 behavior, or both are used.

* Patches from Frank Cusack for much better hardware preauth support
  have been incorporated.

* Patches from Matt Crawford extend the kadmin ACL syntax so that
  restrictions can be imposed on what certain administrators may do to
  certain accounts.

* A KDC on a host with multiple network addresses will now respond to
  a client from the address that the client used to contact it.  The
  means used to implement this will however cause the KDC not to
  listen on network addresses configured after the KDC has started.

Minor changes
-------------

* The shell code for searching for the Tcl package at configure time
  has been modified.  If a tclConfig.sh can be found, the information
  it contains is used, otherwise the old searching method is tried.
  Let us know if this new scheme causes any problems.

* Shared library builds may work on HPUX, Rhapsody/MacOS X, and newer
  Alpha systems now.

* The Windows build will now include kvno and gss-sample.

* The routine krb5_secure_config_files has been disabled.  A new
  routine, krb5_init_secure_context, has been added in its place.

* The routine decode_krb5_ticket is now being exported as
  krb5_decode_ticket.  Any programs that used the old name (which
  should be few) should be changed to use the new name; we will
  probably eliminate the old name in the future.

* The CCAPI-based credentials cache code has been changed to store the
  local-clock time of issue and expiration rather than the KDC-clock
  times.

* On systems with large numbers of IP addresses, "kinit" should do a
  better job of acquiring those addresses to put in the user's
  credentials.

* Several memory leaks in error cases in the gssrpc code have been
  fixed.

* A bug with login clobbering some internal static storage on AIX has
  been fixed.

* Per-library initialization and cleanup functions have been added,
  for use in configurations that dynamically load and unload these
  libraries.

* Many compile-time warnings have been fixed.

* The GSS sample programs have been updated to exercise more of the
  API.

* The telnet server should produce a more meaningful error message if
  authentication is required but not provided.

* Changes have been made to ksu to make it more difficult to use it to
  leak information the user does not have access to.

* The sample config file information for the CYGNUS.COM realm has been
  updated, and the GNU.ORG realm has been added.

* A configure-time option has been added to enable a replay cache in
  the KDC.  We recommend its use when hardware preauthentication is
  being used.  It is enabled by default, and can be disabled if
  desired with the configure-time option --disable-kdc-replay-cache.

* Some new routines have been added to the library and krb5.h.

* A new routine has been added to the prompter interface to allow the
  application to determine which of the strings prompted for is the
  user's password, in case it is needed for other purposes.

* The remote kadmin interface has been enhanced to support the
  specification of key/salt types for a principal.

* New keytab entries' key values can now be specified manually with a
  new command in the ktutil program.

* A longstanding bug where certain krb4 exchanges using the
  compatibility library between systems with different byte orders
  would fail half the time has been fixed.

* A source file under the GPL has been replaced with an equivalent
  under the BSD license.  The file, strftime.c, was part of one of the
  OpenVision admin system applications, and was only used on systems
  that don't have strftime() in their C libraries.

* Many bug reports are still outstanding in our database.  We are
  continuing to work on this backlog.
