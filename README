		   Kerberos Version 5, Release 1.3

			    Release Notes
			The MIT Kerberos Team

Unpacking the Source Distribution
---------------------------------

The source distribution of Kerberos 5 comes in a gzipped tarfile,
krb5-1.3.tar.gz.  Instructions on how to extract the entire
distribution follow.

If you have the GNU tar program and gzip installed, you can simply do:

	gtar zxpf krb5-1.3.tar.gz

If you don't have GNU tar, you will need to get the FSF gzip
distribution and use gzcat:

	gzcat krb5-1.3.tar.gz | tar xpf -

Both of these methods will extract the sources into krb5-1.3/src and
the documentation into krb5-1.3/doc.

Building and Installing Kerberos 5
----------------------------------

The first file you should look at is doc/install-guide.ps; it contains
the notes for building and installing Kerberos 5.  The info file
krb5-install.info has the same information in info file format.  You
can view this using the GNU emacs info-mode, or by using the
standalone info file viewer from the Free Software Foundation.  This
is also available as an HTML file, install.html.

Other good files to look at are admin-guide.ps and user-guide.ps,
which contain the system administrator's guide, and the user's guide,
respectively.  They are also available as info files
kerberos-admin.info and krb5-user.info, respectively.  These files are
also available as HTML files.

If you are attempting to build under Windows, please see the
src/windows/README file.

Reporting Bugs
--------------

Please report any problems/bugs/comments using the krb5-send-pr
program.  The krb5-send-pr program will be installed in the sbin
directory once you have successfully compiled and installed Kerberos
V5 (or if you have installed one of our binary distributions).

If you are not able to use krb5-send-pr because you haven't been able
compile and install Kerberos V5 on any platform, you may send mail to
krb5-bugs@mit.edu.

You may view bug reports by visiting

and logging in as "guest" with password "guest".

Notes, Major Changes, and Known Bugs for 1.3
--------------------------------------------

* We now install the compile_et program, so other packages can use the
  installed com_err library with their own error tables.  (If you use
  our com_err code, that is; see below.)

* The header files we install now assume ANSI/ISO C ('89, not '99).
  We have stopped testing on SunOS 4, even with gcc.  Some of our code
  now has C89-based assumptions, like free(NULL) being well defined,
  that will probably frustrate any attempts to run this code under SunOS
  4 or other pre-C89 systems.

* Some new code, bug fixes, and cleanup for IPv6 support.  [[TODO:
  Insert list of (non-)supporting programs and libraries here.]]

* We have upgraded to autoconf 2.52 (or later), and the syntax for
  specifying certain configuration options have changed.  For example,
  autoconf 2.52 configure scripts let you specify command-line options
  like "configure CC=/some/path/foo-cc", so we have removed some of
  our old options like --with-cc in favor of this approach.

* The client libraries can now use TCP to connect to the KDC.  This
  may be necessary when talking to Microsoft KDCs (domain controllers),
  if they issue you tickets with lots of PAC data.

* If you have versions of the com_err, ss, or Berkeley DB packages
  installed locally, you can use the --with-system-et,
  --with-system-ss, and --with-system-db configure options to use them
  rather than using the versions supplied here.  Note that the
  interfaces are assumed to be similar to those we supply; in
  particular, some older, divergent versions of the com_err library
  may not work with the krb5 sources.  Many configure-time variables
  can be used to help the compiler and linker find the installed
  packages; see the build documentation for details.

* The AES cryptosystem has been implemented.  However, support in the
  Kerberos GSSAPI mechanism has not been written (or even fully
  specified), so it's not fully enabled.  See the documentation for
  details.

Major changes listed by ticket ID
---------------------------------

* [492] PRNG breakage on 64-bit platforms no longer an issue due to
  new PRNG implementation.

* [523] Client library is now compatible with the RC4-based
  cryptosystem used by Windows 2000.

* [709] krb4 long lifetime support has been implemented.

* [880] krb5_gss_register_acceptor_identity() implemented (is called
  gsskrb5_register_acceptor_identity() by Heimdal).

* [1156, 1209] It is now possible to use the system com_err to build
  this release.

* [1174] TCP support added to client library.

* [1175] TCP support added to the KDC, but is disabled by default.

* [1176] autoconf-2.5x is now required by the build system.

* [1184] It is now possible to use the system Berkeley/Sleepycat DB
  library to build this release.

* [1189, 1251] The KfM krb4 library source base has been merged.

* [1190] The default KDC master key type is now triple-DES.  KDCs
  being updated may need their config files updated if they are not
  already specifying the master key type.

* [1190] The default ticket lifetime and default maximum renewable
  ticket lifetime have been extended to one day and one week,
  respectively.

* [1191] A new script, k5srvutil, may be used to manipulate keytabs in
  ways similar to the krb4 ksrvutil utility.

* [1281] The "fakeka" program, which emulates the AFS kaserver, has
  been integrated.  Thanks to Ken Hornstein.

* [1377, 1442, 1443] The Microsoft set-password protocol has been
  implemented.  Thanks to Paul Nelson.

* [1372] There is no longer a need to create a special keytab for
  kadmind.  The legacy administration daemons "kadmind4" and
  "v5passwdd" will still require a keytab, though.

* [1385, 1395, 1410] The krb4 protocol vulnerabilities
  [MITKRB5-SA-2003-004] have been worked around.  Note that this will
  disable krb4 cross-realm functionality, as well as krb4 triple-DES
  functionality.  Please see doc/krb4-xrealm.txt for details of the
  patch.

* [1393] The xdrmem integer overflows [MITKRB5-SA-2003-003] have
  been fixed.

* [1397] The krb5_principal buffer bounds problems
  [MITKRB5-SA-2003-005] have been fixed.  Thanks to Nalin Dahyabhai.

* [1415] Subsession key negotiation has been fixed to allow for
  server-selected subsession keys in the future.

* [1418, 1429, 1446, 1484, 1486, 1487] The AES cryptosystem has been
  implemented.  It is not usable for GSSAPI, though.

* [1491] The client-side functionality of the krb524 library has been
  moved into the krb5 library.

* [1551] The heuristic for locating the Kerberos v4 KDC by prepending
  "kerberos." to the realm name if no config file or DNS information
  is available has been removed.

Minor changes listed by ticket ID
---------------------------------

* [90] default_principal_flags documented.

* [175] Docs refer to appropriate example domains/IPs now.

* [433] --includedir honored now.

* [479] unused argument in try_krb4() in login.c deleted.

* [608] login.krb5 handles SIGHUP more sanely now and thus avoids
  getting the session into a weird state w.r.t. job control.

* [620] krb4 encrypted rcp should work a little better now.  Thanks to
  Greg Hudson.

* [673] Weird echoing of admin password in kadmin client worked around
  by not using buffered stdio calls to read passwords.

* [677] The build system has been reworked to allow the user to set
  CFLAGS, LDFLAGS, CPPFLAGS, etc. reasonably.

* [680] Related to [673], rewrite krb5_prompter_posix() to no longer
  use longjmp(), thus avoiding some bugs relating to non-restoration
  of terminal settings.

* [697] login.krb5 no longer zeroes out the terminal window size.

* [710] decomp_ticket() in libkrb4 now looks up the local realm name
  more correctly.  Thanks to Booker Bense.

* [850] Berekely DB build is better integrated into the krb5 library
  build process.

* [866] lib/krb5/os/localaddr.c and kdc/network.c use a common source
  for local address enumeration now.

* [919] kdc/network.c problems relating to SIOCGIFCONF have been
  fixed.

* [922] An overflow in the string-to-time conversion routines has been
  fixed.

* [935] des-cbc-md4 now included in default enctypes.

* [939] A minor grammatical error has been fixed in a telnet client
  error message.

* [953] des3 no longer failing on Windows due to SHA1 implementation
  problems.

* [970] A minor inconsistency in ccache.tex has been fixed.

* [971] option parsing bugs rendered irrelevant by removal of unused
  gss mechanism.

* [986] Related to [677], problems with the ordering of LDFLAGS
  initialization rendered irrelevant by use of native autoconf
  idioms.

* [992] Related to [677], quirks with --with-cc no longer relevant as
  AC_PROG_CC is used instead now.

* [999] kdc_default_options now honored in gss context initialization.

* [1006] Client library, as well as KDC, now perform reasonable
  sorting of ETYPE-INFO preauthentication data.

* [1055] NULL pointer dereferences in code calling
  krb5_change_password() have been fixed.

* [1063] Initial credentials acquisition failures related to client
  host having a large number of local network interfaces should be
  fixed now.

* [1064] krb5_auth_con_genaddrs() no longer inappropriately returns -1
  on some error cases.

  somewhat.

* [1188] As part of the modernization of our usage of autoconf,
  AC_CONFIG_FILES is now used instead of passing a list of files to
  AC_OUTPUT.

  implemented.

* [1229] The keytab search logic no longer fails prematurely if an
  incorrect encryption type is found.  Thanks to Wyllys Ingersoll.

  sam-pk-for-sad implementation has been aligned.

* [1237] Profile-sharing optimizations from KfM have been merged.

* [1240] Windows calling conventions for krb5int_c_combine_keys() have
  been aligned.
