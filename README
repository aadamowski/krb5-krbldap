                  Kerberos Version 5, Release 1.5.4

                            Release Notes
                        The MIT Kerberos Team

Unpacking the Source Distribution
---------------------------------

The source distribution of Kerberos 5 comes in a gzipped tarfile,
krb5-1.5.4.tar.gz.  Instructions on how to extract the entire
distribution follow.

If you have the GNU tar program and gzip installed, you can simply do:

        gtar zxpf krb5-1.5.4.tar.gz

If you don't have GNU tar, you will need to get the FSF gzip
distribution and use gzcat:

        gzcat krb5-1.5.4.tar.gz | tar xpf -

Both of these methods will extract the sources into krb5-1.5.4/src and
the documentation into krb5-1.5.4/doc.

Building and Installing Kerberos 5
----------------------------------

The first file you should look at is doc/install-guide.ps; it contains
the notes for building and installing Kerberos 5.  The info file
krb5-install.info has the same information in info file format.  You
can view this using the GNU emacs info-mode, or by using the
standalone info file viewer from the Free Software Foundation.  This
is also available as an HTML file, install.html.

Other good files to look at are admin-guide.ps and user-guide.ps,
which contain the system administrator's guide, and the user's guide,
respectively.  They are also available as info files
kerberos-admin.info and krb5-user.info, respectively.  These files are
also available as HTML files.

If you are attempting to build under Windows, please see the
src/windows/README file.  Note that this release might not build
under Windows currently.

Reporting Bugs
--------------

Please report any problems/bugs/comments using the krb5-send-pr
program.  The krb5-send-pr program will be installed in the sbin
directory once you have successfully compiled and installed Kerberos
V5 (or if you have installed one of our binary distributions).

If you are not able to use krb5-send-pr because you haven't been able
compile and install Kerberos V5 on any platform, you may send mail to
krb5-bugs@mit.edu.

[5520]  Fix MITKRB5-SA-2007-003: double-free in kadmind - the RPC
        library could perform a double-free due to a GSS-API library
        bug [CVE-2007-1216, VU#419344]

krb5-1.5.3 changes by ticket ID
-------------------------------

5512    (krb5-1.5.x) MITKRB5-SA-2007-001: telnetd allows login as
        arbitrary user
5513    (krb5-1.5.x) MITKRB5-SA-2007-002: buffer overflow in
        krb5_klog_syslog
5520    (krb5-1.5.x) MITKRB5-SA-2007-003: double-free in kadmind

Major changes in krb5-1.5.2
---------------------------

* Fix for MITKRB5-SA-2006-002: the RPC library could call an
  uninitialized function pointer, which created a security
  vulnerability for kadmind.

* Fix for MITKRB5-SA-2006-003: the GSS-API mechglue layer could fail
  to initialize some output pointers, causing callers to attempt to
  free uninitialized pointers.  This caused a security vulnerability
  in kadmind.

Major known bugs in krb5-1.5.2
------------------------------

5293    crash creating db2 database in non-existent directory

  Attempting to create a KDB in a non-existent directory using the
  Berkeley DB back end may cause a crash resulting from a null pointer
  dereference.  If a core dump occurs, this may cause a local exposure
  of sensitive information such a master key password.  This will be
  fixed in an upcoming patch release.

Major changes in 1.5
--------------------

Kerberos 5 Release 1.5 includes many significant changes to the
Kerberos build system, to GSS-API, and to the Kerberos KDC and
administration system.  These changes build up infrastructure as part
of our efforts to make Kerberos more extensible and flexible.  While
we are confident that these changes will improve Kerberos in the long
run, significant code restructuring may introduce portability problems
or change behavior in ways that break applications.  It is always
important to test a new version of critical security software like
Kerberos before deploying it in your environment to confirm that the
new version meets your environment's requirements.  Because of the
significant restructuring, it is more important than usual to perform
this testing and to report problems you find.

Highlights of major changes include:

* KDB abstraction layer, donated by Novell.

* plug-in architecture, allowing for extension modules to be loaded at
  run-time.

* multi-mechanism GSS-API implementation ("mechglue"), donated by
  Sun Microsystems

* Simple and Protected GSS-API negotiation mechanism ("SPNEGO")
  implementation, donated by Sun Microsystems

* Per-directory ChangeLog files have been deleted.  Releases now
  include auto-generated revision history logs in the combined file
  doc/CHANGES.
