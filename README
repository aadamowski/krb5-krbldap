		   Kerberos Version 5, Release 1.6

			    Release Notes
			The MIT Kerberos Team

Unpacking the Source Distribution
---------------------------------

The source distribution of Kerberos 5 comes in a gzipped tarfile,
krb5-1.6.tar.gz.  Instructions on how to extract the entire
distribution follow.

If you have the GNU tar program and gzip installed, you can simply do:

	gtar zxpf krb5-1.6.tar.gz

If you don't have GNU tar, you will need to get the FSF gzip
distribution and use gzcat:

	gzcat krb5-1.6.tar.gz | tar xpf -

Both of these methods will extract the sources into krb5-1.6/src and
the documentation into krb5-1.6/doc.

Building and Installing Kerberos 5
----------------------------------

The first file you should look at is doc/install-guide.ps; it contains
the notes for building and installing Kerberos 5.  The info file
krb5-install.info has the same information in info file format.  You
can view this using the GNU emacs info-mode, or by using the
standalone info file viewer from the Free Software Foundation.  This
is also available as an HTML file, install.html.

Other good files to look at are admin-guide.ps and user-guide.ps,
which contain the system administrator's guide, and the user's guide,
respectively.  They are also available as info files
kerberos-admin.info and krb5-user.info, respectively.  These files are
also available as HTML files.

If you are attempting to build under Windows, please see the
src/windows/README file.

Reporting Bugs
--------------

Please report any problems/bugs/comments using the krb5-send-pr
program.  The krb5-send-pr program will be installed in the sbin
directory once you have successfully compiled and installed Kerberos
V5 (or if you have installed one of our binary distributions).

If you are not able to use krb5-send-pr because you haven't been able
compile and install Kerberos V5 on any platform, you may send mail to
krb5-bugs@mit.edu.

You may view bug reports by visiting

http://krbdev.mit.edu/rt/

and logging in as "guest" with password "guest".

Major changes in 1.6
----------------------

* Partial client implementation to handle server name referrals.

* Pre-authentication plug-in framework, donated by Red Hat.
