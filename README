Contained herein are:

- trunk: trunk copy with various developmental and debugging code
- ptest.c and Makefile: hacked up version of kvno instrumented for
  various debugging purposes
- setup.sh: script to use the pre-install build environment artifacts
  for testing purposes

The trunk may be of interest.  It's doubtful whether the rest is.
