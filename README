		   Kerberos Version 5, Release 1.0

			    Release Notes

			The MIT Kerberos Team

Unpacking the Source Distribution
---------------------------------

The source distribution of Kerberos 5 comes in three gzipped tarfiles,
krb5-1.0.src.tar.gz, krb5-1.0.doc.tar.gz, and krb5-1.0.crypto.tar.gz.
The krb5-1.0.doc.tar.gz contains the doc/ directory and this README
file.  The krb5-1.0.src.tar.gz contains the src/ directory and this
README file, except for the crypto library sources, which are in
krb5-1.0.crypto.tar.gz.

Instruction on how to extract the entire distribution follow.  These
directions assume that you want to extract into a directory called
DIST.

If you have the GNU tar program and gzip installed, you can simply do:

	mkdir DIST
	cd DIST
	gtar zxpf krb5-1.0.src.tar.gz
	gtar zxpf krb5-1.0.crypto.tar.gz
	gtar zxpf krb5-1.0.doc.tar.gz

If you don't have GNU tar, you will need to get the FSF gzip
distribution and use gzcat:

	mkdir DIST
	cd DIST
	gzcat krb5-1.0.src.tar.gz | tar xpf -
	gzcat krb5-1.0.crypto.tar.gz | tar xpf -
	gzcat krb5-1.0.doc.tar.gz | tar xpf -

Both of these methods will extract the sources into DIST/krb5-1.0/src
and the documentation into DIST/krb5-1.0/doc.

Unpacking the Binary Distribution
---------------------------------

Binary distributions of Kerberos V5 are provided merely as convenience
to those people who wish to try out Kerberos V5 without needing to do
a full compile of Kerberos.

MIT and the MIT Kerberos V5 development team make no guarantees that
we will continue to supply binary distributions for future releases of
Kerberos V5, or for any operating system/platform in particular.
These binary distributions have been prepared by members of the MIT
Kerberos V5 development team, or by volunteers who have graciously
agreed to test the pre-release snapshot.  Each binary build is PGP
signed by the person who prepared the binary distribution for that
particular platform.  

While the binary distribution is *supposed* to correspond exactly to
the 1.0 Kerberos V5 source release, you have no way of knowing whether
the person who prepared the binary release might have inserted a
trojan horse, or a trapdoor.  For all you know, the binary
distribution might be mailing all of your Kerberos keys to
kremvax!boris.  (The same is true for the source distribution, but at
least you can audit the code yourself!)

For this reason, if you are planning on using Kerberos V5 in
production, we strongly suggest that you obtain the source
distribution and compile it from source yourself.

The binary distributions have been compiled so that they will install
in /usr/local.  To install, su to root and and type the command:

	cd /usr/local
	gunzip < /tmp/krb5-1.0.<platform>.tar.gz | tar xvf -


Building and Installing Kerberos 5
----------------------------------

The first file you should look at is doc/install.ps; it contains the
notes for building and installing Kerberos 5.  The info file
krb5-install.info has the same information in info file format.  You
can view this using the GNU emacs info-mode, or by using the
standalone info file viewer from the Free Software Foundation.

Other good files to look at are admin-guide.ps and user-guide.ps,
which contain the system administrator's guide, and the user's guide,
respectively.  They are also available as info files
kerberos-admin.info and krb5-user.info, respectively.

Reporting Bugs
--------------

Please report any problems/bugs/comments using the krb5-send-pr
program.  The krb5-send-pr program will be installed in the sbin
directory once you have successfully compiled and installed Kerberos
V5 (or if you have installed one of our binary distributions).

If you are not able to use krb5-send-pr because you haven't been able
compile and install Kerberos V5 on any platform, you may send mail to
krb5-bugs@mit.edu.

Notes and Major Changes
-----------------------

* We are now using the GNATS system to track bug reports for Kerberos
V5.  It is therefore helpful for people to use the krb5-send-pr
program when reporting bugs.  The old interface of sending mail to
krb5-bugs@mit.edu will still work; however, bug reports sent in this
fashion may experience a delay in being processed.

* The default keytab name has changed from /etc/v5srvtab to
/etc/krb5.keytab.

* login.krb5 no longer defaults to getting krb4 tickets.

* The Windows (win16) DLL, LIBKRB5.DLL, has been renamed to
KRB5_16.DLL.  This change was necessary to distinguish it from the
win32 version, which will be named KRB5_32.DLL.  Note that the
GSSAPI.DLL file has not been renamed, because this name was specified
in a draft standard for the Windows 16 GSSAPI bindings.  (The 32-bit
version of the GSSAPI DLL will be named GSSAPI32.DLL.)

* The directory structure used for installations has changed.  In
particular, files previously located in $prefix/lib/krb5kdc are now
normally located in $sysconfdir/krb5kdc.  With the normal configure
options, this means the KDC database goes in /usr/local/var/krb5kdc by
default.  If you wish to have the old behavior, then you would use a
configure line like the following:

	configure --prefix=/usr/local --sysconfdir=/usr/local/lib

* kshd has been modified to accept krb4 encrypted rcp connections; for
this to work, the v4rcp program must be in the sbin directory.

* The gssrpc library has symbol collisions with the rpc library in
some of the libcs in certain operating systems without shared
libraries, notably some ports of NetBSD and MkLinux.  For those
platforms which have rpc in libc and also contain NIS in libc,
compiling with static libraries will not work because of this
conflict.  NetBSD users can either upgrade to the current tree, which
includes shared libraries for more ports, choose not to build kadmind
or kadmin, or recompile NetBSD without NIS support.  MkLinux users
must either recompile without NIS or not build the administration
system.
