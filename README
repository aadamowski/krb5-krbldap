Kerberos 5 Release 1.0 README file
----------------------------------

    It was the dawn of the second system of mankind, ten years
    after the release of Kerberos 4.  The Kerberos Project was a
    dream given form. Its goal: to prevent another war by
    creating a place where clients and servers could work out
    their connections peacefully.  It's a protected port -- home
    away from home for rsh, rlogin, kftp, and khttp.  Clients and
    servers wrapped in two million, five hundred thousand lines
    of spinning code, all alone on the disk.  It can be a
    dangerous place, but it's out last best hope for security.

    This is the story of the last of the Kerberos releases.  The
    year is 1996.  The name of the software is Kerberos 5.

   performed by MIT and the Kerberos community.

Building and Installing Kerberos 5
----------------------------------

The first file you should look at is doc/install.ps; it contains the
notes for building and installing Kerberos 5.  The info file
krb5-install.info has the same information in info file format.  You
can view this using the GNU emacs info-mode, or by using the
standalone info file viewer from the Free Software Foundation.

Other good files to look at are admin-guide.ps and user-guide.ps,
which contain the system administrator's guide, and the user's guide,
respectively.  They are also available as info files
kerberos-admin.info and krb5-user.info, respectively.

Notes and Major Changes
-----------------------

The default keytab name has changed from /etc/v5srvtab to /etc/krb5.keytab.
