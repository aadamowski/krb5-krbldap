- teach krb5_get_cred_via_tkt that referrals are OK, really
- code (or explicitly punt) edge cases in krb5_get_cred_from_kdc_opt

- add klist option to print actual credential principal

- review code for:
  - string safety, particularly strcmp use
  - memory leaks
- check assumptions on dereference of credential members
- code format
- remove tracing/debugging code
