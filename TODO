blocking issues for beta release
================================
- fix memory management problems and any other known crash/assertion-fail 
  cases
  - kvno crashes freeing in_cred after the call completes.  why is this?
    reproduce: "kvno host/maybe.not.ms.mit.edu@NOT.MS.MIT.EDU"
  - assertion failure: "./ptest argos.mit.edu"
    - might require NOT tickets and no domain_realm setting
    - no longer reproducible?
  - fix double-free in gc_from_kdc_opt cleanup
- correctly return first-hop TGTs for ccache storage
  - old code was convoluted and buggy.  replace.
- referral loop checking
- testing, cleanup, documentation

further work:
============
- write up understanding of current referral logic to krbcore
  - given the length of conversations with hartmans and raeburn, others
    are likely to take issue with the finer points.
  - review implementation notes against actual implementation, document changes
- add klist option to print actual credential principal
- padata parsing for referral data verification and possible principal rewrite

testing issues:
==============
- verify that cached tickets work properly
- verify that intermediate TGTs aren't cached
- Should we do the single non-referral fallback always or only on certain
  KDC failure states?  Probably answer this from testing.
- credential cacheing unreliable; investiagate
  - "kvno host/argos.mit.edu@NOT.MS.MIT.EDU" with NOT tickets fills up ccache

low-priority:
- code (or explicitly punt) edge cases in krb5_get_cred_from_kdc_opt

final cleanup:
=============
- check namespace use with tom
- review code for:
  - string safety, particularly strcmp use -- nothing is guaranteed to be a string,
    do not use string functions at all.
  - memory leaks
- check assumptions on assumed dereferencability of credential members
- review code format
