questions:
- should do_traversal code for old-style lookups still be requesting referrals?
  If so, within what scope should they actually be used?

current:
- rewrite verification to be more tightly-coupled to referral case
- when should ccache be checked during referral process?  never?
- free TGTs at fallback
- add error reporting to end of gc_from_kdc
- deal with fetching remote TGTs after all before referrals
  - this is needed in domain_realm case

bug fixes:
- kvno crashes freeing in_cred after the call completes.  why is this?
  reproduce: "kvno host/maybe.not.ms.mit.edu@NOT.MS.MIT.EDU"
- assertion failure: "./ptest argos.mit.edu"
  - might require NOT tickets and no domain_realm setting

low-priority:
- code (or explicitly punt) edge cases in krb5_get_cred_from_kdc_opt
- add klist option to print actual credential principal
- referral loop checking

later, high-priority, hard:
- padata parsing

testing issues:
- verify that cached tickets work properly
- verify that intermediate TGTs aren't cached but 

final:
- check namespace use with tom
- review code for:
  - string safety, particularly strcmp use -- nothing is guaranteed to be a string,
    do not use string functions at all.
  - memory leaks
- check assumptions on assumed dereferencability of credential members
- review code format
- #ifdef out tracing/debugging code
- review implementation notes against actual implementation
