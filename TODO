blocking issues for beta release
================================
- referral loop checking
- maybe don't return first-hop referral TGT for ccache if it's cached already?
- testing, cleanup, documentation

further work:
============
- write up understanding of current referral logic to krbcore
  - given the length of conversations with hartmans and raeburn, others
    are likely to take issue with the finer points.
  - review implementation notes against actual implementation, document changes
- add klist option to print actual credential principal
- padata parsing for referral data verification and possible principal rewrite
- KDC support for referrals

testing issues:
==============
- verify that cached tickets work properly
- verify that intermediate TGTs aren't cached
- Should we do the single non-referral fallback always or only on certain
  KDC failure states?  Probably answer this from testing.

low-priority:
- code (or explicitly punt) edge cases in krb5_get_cred_from_kdc_opt

final cleanup: (pre-beta)
=============
- scan for leftover bogosities with "XXX" tag
- check namespace use with tom
- review code for:
  - string safety, particularly strcmp use -- nothing is guaranteed to be a string,
    do not use string functions at all.
  - memory leaks
- check assumptions on assumed dereferencability of credential members
- review code format
