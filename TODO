current:

- now that we're getting real referral tickets handle them properly in krb5_get_cred_from_kdc_opt
- referral-relevant credential checks in krb5_get_cred_via_tkt completely disabled; fix

low-priority:

- code (or explicitly punt) edge cases in krb5_get_cred_from_kdc_opt
- add klist option to print actual credential principal

final:

- check namespace use with tom
- review code for:
  - string safety, particularly strcmp use
  - memory leaks
- check assumptions on dereference of credential members
- code format
- remove tracing/debugging code
