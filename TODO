outstanding issues:
==================
- Should we return the first-hop referral TGT for ccache even if it's
  cached already?  Sure, it's newer than anything we'd have, but do we
  really want to stuff the cache full of almost-identical TGTs if we're
  doing repeated referrals to the same destination?  Is there a point in
  returning it at all, since future referrals won't use it and
  the first non-referral request to that realm (should such a request
  ever occur) will incur one extra round-trip after which it will be
  cached?

final cleanup:
=============
- rereview code
  - string safety, particularly strcmp use -- little is guaranteed to be a string,
    do not use string functions without extreme caution. (done)
  - memory leaks (first pass done, vg runs clean)
  - other memory management issues (open-ended, but looking)
- review code format (whitespace checked)
  -- nuke icky // comments (and probably attatched code)
- catalog namespace changes for review

integration issues:
==================
- review namespace use
- decide whether to up MAXHOPS
- merge with current trunk

testing issues/open questions:
=============================
- Should we do the single non-referral fallback always or only on certain
  KDC failure states?  Probably answer this from testing.

further work:
============
- write up understanding of current referral logic to krbcore
  - given the length of conversations with hartmans and raeburn, others
    are likely to take issue with the finer points.
  - review implementation notes against actual implementation, document changes
- add klist option to print actual credential principal
- padata parsing for referral data verification and possible principal rewrite
- KDC support for referrals
