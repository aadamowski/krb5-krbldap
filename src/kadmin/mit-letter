OpenVision Technologies, Inc., is pleased to announce the donation of
its Kerberos Administration system to MIT for inclusion in the
standard Kerberos 5 distribution.  This donation, along with our
GSS-API implementation donated in June 1994, underscores our
committment to Kerberos and our gratitude to both MIT and the Kerberos
community for all their work that has benefitted us over the years.

The package we are donating includes:

	o the Kerberos Administration server

	o the client- and server-side libraries that implement the
	ovsec_kadm API

	o Administration database utilities (create, import, export)

	o a Kerberos 4 to OpenVision Kerberos Administration system
	password-changing protocol converter

	o a modified ONC RPC containing our AUTH_GSSAPI
	authentication flavor

A command-line interface to the OpenVision Kerberos Administration
system has already been developed by MIT and will also be included in
the Kerberos 5 distribution.

The package we are donating is subject to the following copyright,
which must be included in the README on athena-dist.mit.edu that
provides instructions on obtaining Kerberos 5:
