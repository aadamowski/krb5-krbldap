NAME
	kadmin - a command line interface to the
	OpenV*Secure administration system

SYNOPSYS
	kadmin [-r _realm_] [[-p _principal_] [-k _keytab_]]
	[-w _password_ ] [-q _query_]

DESCRIPTION
	kadmin is a command-line interface to the Kerberos*Secure
	administration system.  It provides most of the functionality
	of the secure_admin(8) GUI.  It does not provide keytab
	management; that functionality is provided by the command-line
	program ovsec_edit_keytab(8).  kadmin should be used instead
	of kdb5_edit(8) because kadmin does not bypass the
	OpenV*Secure Administration server.

       	If given the -p option, kadmin will use the specified
	principal to authenticate.  If the -p option is not given,
	kadmin will default to $USER/admin (if the environment
	variable USER is set).  If $USER is not set, then the first
	component of the principal will be the username as obtained
	from getuid(). If given -k, kadmin will not prompt for a
	password, but rather use the specified keytab.  Also, if the
	-k option is given, the default principal will be the
	host/hostname.  If -r is present, then kadmin will use the
	specified realm as the default database realm rather than the
	default realm for the local machine.

	If given the -w option, kadmin will use the password provided
	on the command line instead of prompting for one on the TTY.
	WARNING!  Placing the password for a Kerberos principal with
	administration access into a shell script is EXTREMELY
	DANGEROUS and should only be done if you are highly sure that
	the script will not fall into the wrong hands.

	Upon starting up, kadmin will prompt for a password (unless
	the -k or -w option has been given).  The program will then
	obtain tickets for ovsec_admin/admin in the default realm
	(unless -r has been specified, in which case it will use the
	specified realm).  The ticket is stored in a separate ccache,
	unless -c is specified.  The lifetime for these tickets is 5
	minutes.

	The -q option allows the passing of a request directly to
	kadmin, which will then exit.  This can be useful for writing
	scripts.

DATE FORMAT 
        Various commands in kadmin can take a variety of
	date formats, specifying durations or absolute times.
	Examples of valid formats are:

		1 month ago
		2 hours ago
		400000 seconds ago
		last year
		last Monday
		yesterday
		a fortnight ago
		3/31/92 10:00:07 PST
		January 23, 1987 10:05pm
		22:00 GMT

	Dates which do not have the "ago" specifier default to being
	absolute dates, unless they appear in a field where a duration
	is expected.  In that case the time specifier will be
	interpreted as relative.  Specifying "ago" on a duration may
	result in unexpected behaviour.

COMMAND DESCRIPTIONS

add_principal [options] _newprinc_
	creates the principal _newprinc_, prompting twice for a
	password.  This command requires the "add" privilege.  This
	command has the aliases "addprinc", "ank".

	OPTIONS
	-salt _salttype_
		uses the specified salt instead of the default V5 salt
		for generating the key.  Valid values for _salttype_
		are:
			full_name (aliases "v5_salt", "normal")
			name_only
			realm_only
			no_salt (alias "v4_salt")

	-expire _expdate_
		expiration date of the principal

	-pwexpire _pwexpdate_
		password expiration date

	-maxlife _maxlife_
		maximum ticket life of the principal

	-kvno _kvno_
		explicity set the key version number.  This is not
		recommended.

	-policy _policy_
		policy used by this principal.  If no policy is
		supplied, the principal will default to having no
		policy, and a warning message will be printed.

	{-|+}allow_tgs_req
		"-allow_tgs_req" specifies that a TGS request for a
		ticket for a service ticket for this principal is not
		permitted.  This option is useless for most things.
		"+allow_tgs_req" clears this flag.  The default is
		"+allow_tgs_req".  In effect, "-allow_tgs_req" sets
		the KRB5_KDB_DISALLOW_TGT_BASED flag on the principal
		in the database.

	{-|+}allow_tix
		"-allow_tix" forbids the issuance of any tickets for
		this principal.  "+allow_tix" clears this flag.  The
		default is "+allow_tix".  In effect, "-allow_tix" sets
		the KRB5_KDB_DISALLOW_ALL_TIX flag on the principal in
		the database.

	{-|+}needchange
		"+needchange" sets a flag in attributes field to force
		a password change; "-needchange" clears it.  The
		default is "-needchange".  In effect, "+needchange"
		sets the KRB5_KDB_REQUIRES_PWCHANGE flag on the
		principal in the database.

	{-|+}password_changing_service
		"+password_changing_service" sets a flag in the
		attributes field marking this as a password change
		service principal (useless for most things).
		"-password_changing_service" clears the flag.  This
		flag intentionally has a long name.  The default is
		"-password_changing_service".  In effect,
		"+password_changing_service" sets the
		KRB5_KDB_PWCHANGE_SERVICE flag on the principal in the
		database.

	-randpass
		sets the key of the principal to a random value

	-pw _password_
		sets the key of the principal to the specified string
		and does not prompt for a password.  This is not
		recommended.

	EXAMPLE
	kadmin: addprinc tlyu/deity
	WARNING: no policy specified for "tlyu/deity@ATHENA.MIT.EDU";
	defaulting to no policy.
	Enter password for principal tlyu/deity@ATHENA.MIT.EDU:

	OVSEC_KADM_PASS_Q_* (password quality violations)

delete_principal [-force] _principal_
