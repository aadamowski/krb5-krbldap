	* helpers.exp (exp_prog): the check for non-newline-terminated
 	stdout was causing failures where there weren't any.  Barry

	* Makefile.ov (unit-test-body), helpers.exp: some versions of
 	runtest do not like digits in command-line variable names. 
 	* Makefile.ov (unit-test-body), helpers.exp: ovsec_v4adm_server

	* getpid.sh: grep out any programs with expect or kadmind4 in
 	their names.
