Wed Nov 20 18:32:06 1996  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in (KLIB): Change libkrb5.dll to be krb516.dll

Wed Jun 12 00:20:08 1996  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@rsts-11.mit.edu>

	* makefile: Renamed to Makefile.in, so that we can do WIN16/WIN32
 		specializations.  Remove /nologo option for Win32 RFLAGS,
 		since RC apparently doesn't support it.

	* changelo: Renamed to ChangeLog, to make life easier.

Wed Jan 10 23:16:41 1996  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* cns.rc: Add an #ifdef for enabling lower case realm (for use
		with DCE).

	* cns.c (kwin_command): When obtaining tickets, we make them
		forwardable by default.  XXX This should really a
		configurable option in the UI.

Thu Apr 27 11:46:42 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* cns.c, cns.rc, krbini.h: K5 no longer has conf and realms files
	   but one generic config file. Changed options menu to so we can
	   specify where it lives.

Thu Apr 20 12:17:34 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* cns.c, tktlist.c, krbini.h: Fixed up #include so it
	   it only relies on krb5.h. We now include winsock 
	   ourselves and we needed to pull one constant out of
	   k5-config.h (INI_KRB_CCACHE).

Wed Apr 5 16:01:16 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

           edit boxes, add hidden button for better CR handling.
        * cns.c: used krb5_us_timeofday instead of krb5_timeofday
