	       Building & Running Kerberos 5 on Windows
	       ----------------------------------------

Kerberos 5 Windows support now only includes Win32 and no longer
includes Win16.

We build Kerberos 5 on Windows just with MSVC++ 6.0.  You should
not need anything else.  We do not know whether it currently
builds with other compilers or make utilities.

These build instructions assume that you got a standalong source
distribution of Kerberos 5 rather than the MIT Kerberos for Win32
distribution (which includes a working Kerberos 4).

There are two methods for building a Windows version of Kerberos 5.
The traditional method involves starting on a Unix machine and
creating a distribution that can be built on Windows.  The second
method works from the sources that come from the Unix distribution if
you have certain Unix-type utilities.


Traditional Build Method:
------------------------

On the Unix side
1) cd xxx/src                          # Go to where the source lives
2) make -f Makefile.in kerbsrc.zip     # Do some Unix-side configuring
                                       # ...and create kerbsrc.zip
3) <transfer kerbsrc.zip to the PC>


On the PC side
1) md \krb5                            # Create where we'll put the tree
2) cd \krb5
3) unzip kerbsrc.zip
        - or -
   pkunzip -d kerbsrc.zip
4) nmake -nologo                       # Build the sources
5) nmake install		       # Copy headers, libs, executables


All-Windows Build Method:
------------------------

First, make sure you have sed, gawk, cat, and cp.

1) cd xxx/src                          # Go to where the source lives
2) nmake -f Makefile.in prep-windows   # Create Makefile for Windows
3) nmake -nologo                       # Build the sources
4) nmake install		       # Copy headers, libs, executables


Notes on the install Target:
---------------------------

For the install target, you will need to define KRB_INSTALL_DIR to
point to the directory where the header, library, and executable files
will be installed.  You can either define this in the environment or
at the nmake command-line.  For example:

nmake install KRB_INSTALL_DIR=c:\sdk\krb5

Make sure you create the directory first.  Otherwise, nmake will
complain.  The files will get installed into include, lib, and bin
subdirectories.  You can then copy the binaries to where ever you want
have them (probably somewhere in your path).


Running Kerberos 5 Apps:
-----------------------

Make sure you have a valid krb5.ini file.  That will look just like a
Unix krb5.conf file.  You can place this file in the same directory as
your krb5_32.dll or in your Windows directory.  You should then be
able to run the applications that are built.


Othes Issues:
------------

The krb4_32.dll that is built (but not installed) is not supported.
If you need Kerberos 4, you can use the krbv4w32.dll that MIT puts
out.


More Information:
----------------

For more information, please read the Kerberos 5 documentation in
the doc directory of the distribution.
