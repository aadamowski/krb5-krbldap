Building Windows Kerberos 5

We build Kerberos 5 on Windows just with MSVC++ 6.0.  You should
not need anything else.  We do not know whether it currently
builds with other compilers or make utilities.

There are two basic methods for making the Windows version of Kerberos
5.  The traditional method involves starting on a Unix machine and
creating a distribution that can be built on Windows.  The second
method works from the sources that come from the CVS tree if you have
certain Unix-type utilities.

Traditional Method:
------------------

On the Unix side
1) cd xxx/src                          # Go to where the source lives
2) make -f Makefile.in kerbsrc.zip     # Do some Unix-side configuring
                                       # ...and create kerbsrc.zip
3) <transfer kerbsrc.zip to the PC>


On the PC side
1) md \k5                              # Create where we'll put the tree
2) cd \k5
3) unzip kerbsrc.zip
        - or -
   pkunzip -d kerbsrc.zip
4) nmake -nologo                       # Build the sources
5) nmake mkbin			       # Place binaries generated by the 
                                       # ...build in the kbin directory
6) <make sure the configuration file krb5.ini is in the \windows or \winnt 
    directory.>


All-Windows Method:
------------------

First, make sure you have sed, gawk, cat, and cp.

1) cd xxx/src                          # Go to where the source lives
2) nmake -f Makefile.in prep-windows   # Create Makefile for Windows
3) nmake -nologo                       # Build the sources
4) nmake mkbin			       # Place binaries generated by the 
                                       # ...build in the kbin directory
