<h1>Configuring NetIDMgr and identities</h1>

<p>All NetIDMgr configuration options can be accessed via the <span
class="pre">Options</span> menu.  The available configuration panels
are:
</p>

<p>
<ul>
  <li><p><span class="title">General</span>: General application options
  for NetIDMgr.</p>

  <ul>

    <li><p><span class="title">Obtain new credentials at
    startup</span>: If checked, NetIDMgr will check there are initial
    credentials for the default identity.  If no such credentials are
    found, NetIDMgr will display a new credentials dialog.</p> </li>

    <li><p><span class="title">Run NetIDMgr in system tray after
    window close</span>: If checked, NetIDMgr will continue running in
    the system notification area (sometimes referred to as the system
    tray) after you close the NetIDMgr window.</p> </li>

    <li><p><span class="title">Monitor network connectivity</span>: When
    changes to network connectivity are detected, NetIDMgr can notify
    individual plug-ins about these changes.  Doing so allows each
    plug-in to respond to the change by obtaining new credentials etc.
    If this option is cleared, no such notifications are sent and the
    application would not respond to network changes.</p></li>

    <li><p><span class="title">Log trace events</span>: NetIDMgr can
    generate debugging information during the course of performing
    certain actions.  This information aids the developers in fixing
    problems that you may encounter while using NetIDMgr.</p> </li>

  </ul>

  </li>

  <li><p><span class="title">Appearance</span>: Allows you to set the
  font used by NetIDMgr.</p></li>

  <li><p><span class="title">Identities</span>: Default settings for all
  identities and settings for each identity.  Details <a
  href="#cfg_idents">below</a>.</p></li>

  <li><p><span class="title">Notifications</span>: Notification and timer
  options.  NetIDMgr can issue warnings when credentials are about to
  expire. This configuration panel allows you to set the thresholds at
  which these warnings are issued.  For example, if the warning
  timeout is set for 10 minutes, NetIDMgr will issue a warning 10
  minutes before a credential expires.</p>

  <p>The panel also allows you to control the credentials renew timer.
  If the timer is disabled, NetIDMgr will not automatically attempt to
  renew credentials.  If the <span class="pre">Renew at half life
  intervals when possible</span> option is set, then the timer will
  expire after the credential has less than half its lifetime left.
  If the renewal operation fails, it will attempt another renwal after
  half of the remaining liftime is over (i.e. when the credential has
  less than 1/4 of its original lifetime left) and so on.
  </p>

  </li>

  <li><p><span class="title">Plugins</span>: Enable/disable and check
  the status of registered plug-ins.  Enabling or disabling a plug-in
  only takes effect after a restart of NetIDMgr.</p></li>

</ul>

<h3>Configuration of default settings for all identities</h3>

<p>The <span class="pre">Identities</span> configuration panel allows
you to set the defaults that will be used for all identities.
However, most of the settings displayed here can be overridden with
specific per-identity settings.
</p>

<p>The panel will have a number of sub panels (or tabs) corresponding
to each plug-in that maintains per-identity configuration.
</p>

<p>A list of identities for which configuration information is
maintained will be shown under the main <span
class="pre">Identities</span> configuration panel name.  Each of these
correspond to a <a href="#cfg_ident">per identity</a> configuration
panel.
</p>

<p>Note that adding or removing an identity in the configuration panel
only has the effect of adding or removing the identity to or from the
list of identities for which configuration information is maintained.

<h3>Per identity configuration</h3>

<p>You can access the per-identity configuration panel for a specific
identity by selecting the identity name from the list of configuration
panels in the configuration dialog.
</p>

<p>These panels are similar to the <span class="pre">Identities</span>
configuration panel, but they change per-identity settings.  Changes
you make in these panels will override the defaults set in the <span
class="pre">Identities</span> panel.
