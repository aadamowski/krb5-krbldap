<h1>Help Menu</h1>

<p>
You can activate the menu by pressing <span class="pre">Alt + H</span>
and you can activate each action by pressing the highlighted character.
</p>

<p>
You can invoke help anytime by pressing the <span
class="pre">F1</span> key or if you are in a dialog box, by clicking
the question mark icon in the title bar and then clicking on the
dialog box control that you want help with.
</p>

<p>
This is the help menu.  While it is ironic that the help menu itself
needs to be explained, we have decided to include it here just for
completeness.  It is bad enough that it is the last menu on the menu
bar.  We didn't want to pile on any more disrespect by not documenting
it.  We encourage you to not read this and just go ahead and click any
item on this menu.  It is guaranteed that nothing bad will happen.
This is not a generalization that would extend to, say, the <a
href="menu_credential.htm">Credentials</a> menu.  If anything bad
happens, please file a bug report at <a
href="mailto:kfw-bugs@mit.edu">kfw-bugs@mit.edu</a>.
