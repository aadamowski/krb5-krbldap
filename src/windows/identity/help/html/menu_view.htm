<ul>

<li><a name="choosecol" /> <span class="title">Choolse Columns
...</span>: Invokes a dialog where you can choose which columns are
displayed in the view window.  If you change the columns, or their
order, a new custom layout will be created for you which you can later
use using the <span class="pre">Layout</span> submenu later.</li>

<li><a name="layout" /> <span class="title">Layout</span>: Opens a
submenu where you can select the layout for the credentials
display.
   <ul>

      <li><span class="title">By Identity</span>: A predefined layout
      where the credentials will be grouped by identity and by
      credentials type, in that order.</li>

      <li><span class="title">By Type</span>: A predefined layout
      where the credentials are grouped by credentials type</li>

      <li><span class="title">By Location</span>: A predefined layout
      where the credentials are grouped by the location where they are
      stored in.  For Kerberos 5, the location is the name of the
      credentials cache in which the tickets are stored, and for AFS,
      the locatino is always the cache manager.  Individual <a
      href="concept_cred_pro.htm">credential providers</a> choose the
      interpretation of the <span class="pre">location</span> property
      as the concept of location changes from type to type.</li>

      <li><span class="title">Custom</span>: The custom layout.  If
      you customize the layout by adding, removing or reordering the
      columns, then NetIDMgr will create a new custom layout using the
      customizations.  You can choose this option to revisit that layout</li>

<span class="title">Toolbars</span>: Enable or disable toolbars.</li>
