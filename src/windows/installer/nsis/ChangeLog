* kfw.nsi, kfw-fixed.nsi, utils.nsi:
  - replace the UpdateDLL macro with the ReplaceDLL macro
  - use ReplaceDLL to install all .exe and .dll files
  this will allow the installer to work even when some files
  are loaded by modules which cannot be terminated such as 
  Network Providers (afslogon.dll for example)

* kfw-fixed.nsi:  add kvno.exe, gss-client.exe, gss-server.exe
