		obj/$(CPU)/{dbg,rel}.

1999-03-31  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@rsts-11.mit.edu>

	* post.in (Makefile): Don't try to run autoconf with $(SHELL),
		since this doesn't work if $(AUTOCONF) isn't a path to the
		built-in autoconf, but just an unqualified pathname to the
		system autoconf.  [krb5-build/707]

1999-02-19  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@rsts-11.mit.edu>

	* windows.in (DLL_FILE_DEF): Add makefile controls to set either
		KRB5_DLL_FILE or GSS_DLL_FILE, with the default being
		KRB5_DLL_FILE.

Mon Feb  8 22:13:23 1999  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@mit.edu>

	* winexclude.sed: Add .dll and .lib files to the list of functions
 		which shouldn't get included in the non-binary list of
 		files to be added to kerbsrc.zip for the Windows build.
		(If .dll or .lib files need to be included in the zip
 		file, they must be added to the WINBINARYFILES macro in
 		the top-level Makefile.in)

1998-11-13  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@rsts-11.mit.edu>

	* post.in (*-recurse): If $(MY_SUBDIRS) is non-NULL use it instead
		of $(SUBDIRS) to control which directories are iterated
		over.  (This is needed so we can fold a directory's
		configure.in scripts into the parent's configure.in
		without having to move all of its siblings as well into
		the parent directory's configure.in.  This is because if
		the parent's configure.in file as a AC_CONFIG_DIRS macro,
		it gets included into all the $(SUBDIRS) macro of *all*
		of its generated makefiles, and this is wrong for all
		but the Makefile.in of the parent directory.  For example,
		if the configure.in in src/appl contains
		AC_CONFIG_DIRS(bsd telnet gssftp), and that configure
		script also generates the Makefile.in for src/appl/sample,
		then SUBDIRS will contain "bsd telnet gssftp" plus
		whatever LOCAL_SUBDIRS is defined to contain.  This
		doesn't work.  So instead of defining LOCAL_SUBDIRS,
		the Makefile.in in src/appl/sample defines MY_SUBDIRS,
		which completely overrides the SUBDIRS macro.
		Eventually, we should replace all of the LOCAL_SUBDIRS
		definitions in the Makefile.in's with MY_SUBDIRS, and
		add MY_SUBDIRS definitions into all Makefile.in's that
		don't currently have then, and depend on
		AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS to insert the right magic value into
		SUBDIRS.  At that point, we can get rid of the SUBDIR
		definition in pre.in, and remove this test from
		post.in which tests of MY_SUBDIRS and uses it in
		preference to SUBDIRS, and simply always use MY_SUBDIRS.)

1998-05-27  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@rsts-11.mit.edu>

	* windows.in: Remove -DLEHMAN, which doesn't do anything.  (A grep
		through the whole source tree shows no instances of #ifdef
		LEHMAN)

Sun May 24 21:39:49 1998  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@mit.edu>

	* windows.in (ABS,S,C): Use double backslashes for the path
		separators to workaround Microsoft NMAKE brain damaging.
		Sometimes backslashes are treated as a quoting characters,
		and sometimes not, with no rhyme or reason that I can
		determine.  Fortunatelly double backslashes in pathanmes
		don't seem to hurt (for the times when the backslash isn't
		treated as a quoating character).  Whoever decided Windows
		should use backslash as a path separator should be shot.

Wed Apr 15 18:01:39 1998  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* pre.in (CRYPTO_DEPLIB):
	(KRB5_BASE_LIBS):

	* pre.in: Define AUTOCONF and CONFIG_RELTOPDIR from the autoconf
 		substitution macros.

	* post.in: Fix the call to autoconf to use $(AUTOCONF) and
	 	$(CONFIG_RELTOPDIR), so that configure regeneration rule
	 	works even in a subdirectory below the configure script.

 		for Rhapsody DR1.

Mon Feb  2 17:02:29 1998  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@rsts-11.mit.edu>

	* pre.in: SUBDIRS now also includes LOCAL_SUBDIRS, which is
		defined in the Makefile.in to control the recursive
		descent through the subdirectories.  This is used so
		that the subdirectories can be defined in Makefile.in,
		instead of in the individual configure.in files.

	        KRB5_BASE_DEPLBS)

Sat Mar  1 14:33:21 1997  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* libobj.in: Change .c.so and .c.po rules to work better with
	compilers that insist that $(CC) -fpic -c foo.c -o foo.so is

	* libobj.in (OBJS.*): Work around a gmake optimization where the
		timestamps of OBJS.* would not get checked after STAMP.* get
		updated, even though OBJS.* get updated as a side effect.

	* pre.in: Don't actually add the $(CPPOPTS) flags to CPPFLAGS;

		the CPPOPTS makefile variable at all; we don't need it.

	* pre.in: Add support for a new --with-cppopts" value where you
		can put -DXXXXX such that they are found by autoconf tests
		that use run the preprocessor over header files.
