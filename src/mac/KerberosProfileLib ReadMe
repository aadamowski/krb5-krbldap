KerberosProfileLib implements the Kerberos profile API, used for reading and writing
Kerberos configuration files. See profile.h for API documentation.

Note that you should rarely, if ever, use profile_init or profile_init_path. You 
probably mean to use krb5_get_profile, to avoid making your code depend on the
location of a specific Kerberos 5 preferences file. This is especially important
as the name and possibly the location of Kerberos configuration file is going to
change in the future.

Also note that you need both Kerberos5Lib:Headers: and KerberosProfileLib:Headers:
in your include path to use profile.h
