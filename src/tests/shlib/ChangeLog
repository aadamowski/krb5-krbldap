	* t_loader.c (verbose): New variable.
	(do_close_1): Drop filename argument.  Change messages
	accordingly, and only display them if verbose.  Line up "done"
	messages vertically.
	(do_open_1): Likewise.  Add library version argument, used when on
	AIX, in combination with RTLD_MEMBER.
	(do_open): Don't pass filename.  Do pass library version; callers
	changed.

	(get_sym_1): Renamed from get_sym, added line number argument.
	Print messages if verbose.
	(get_sym): New macro.

	(main): Turn off output buffering.  Print messages before and
	after calling functions in loaded libraries.  Disable first set of
	tests, that don't call any functions.  Test gssapi library without
	loading any other libraries, then test it after loading com_err,
	and unload com_err first.
