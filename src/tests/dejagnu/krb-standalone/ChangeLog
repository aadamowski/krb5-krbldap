	* gssftp.exp: Fix the expect string so that it doesn't assume that

		contains $localhostname, plus optional characters (which
		can be the domainname depending on the system.)

		addv4 function test since it isn't supported in the same way.


Mon Jul 17 15:27:34 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
