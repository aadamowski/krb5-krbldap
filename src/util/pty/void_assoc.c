 * This routine will be called twice.  It's not particularly important
 * that the setsid() or TIOCSTTY ioctls succeed (they may not the
 * second time), but rather that we have a controlling terminal at the
 * end.  It is assumed that vhangup doesn't exist and confuse the
 * process's notion of controlling terminal on any system without
 * TIOCNOTTY.  That is, either vhangup() leaves the controlling
 * terminal in tact, breaks the association completely, or the system
 * provides TIOCNOTTY to get things back into a reasonable state.  In
 * practice, vhangup() either breaks the association completely or
 * doesn't effect controlling terminals, so this condition is met.
