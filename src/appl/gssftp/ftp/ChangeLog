2001-10-29  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@mit.edu>

	* secure.c: Instead of hard wiring the FUDGE_FACTOR, new variables
	to keep track of the total buffer length desired and the actual
	maximum that can be fitted. Add secure_determine_constants() to
	determine the mechanism dependent overhead. This has a hard limit
	for krb4 - for gssapi use gss_wrap_size_limit.
	[pullup from trunk]

2001-10-26  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

	* cmds.c (setpeer): Use unsigned short for port number.  Patch
	from Garry Zacheiss.

2000-05-11  Nalin Dahyabhai  <nalin@redhat.com>

	* domacro.c (domacro): Don't overflow "line2"
	* ftp.c (getreply, krb4 compat): Bail if message data too big for buffer
	(getreply, gssapi): Ditto.
	(pswitch): Don't overflow "ntin", "ntout", "mapin", "mapout".
	(do_auth, krb4 compat): Don't overflow "realm".

2000-04-27  Nalin Dahyabhai  <nalin@redhat.com>

	* cmds.c (remglob): Don't overflow buffer "temp".
	(shell): Don't overflow buffer "shellnam".
	(quote1): "buf"
	* glob.c (ftpglob): Fix boundary in buffer "agpath".
	(expand): Don't overflow buffer pointed to by "gpath".
	(execbrc): Don't overflow buffer "restbuf".

2000-02-18  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

	* cmds.c (mls): Declare some variables volatile to protect against
	getting clobbered by setjmp/longjmp.
	* ftp.c (sendrequest, recvrequest, proxtrans): Ditto.
	* main.c (main): Ditto.
	* pclose.c (mypopen): Ditto.

1999-10-26  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Clean up usage of CFLAGS, CPPFLAGS, DEFS, DEFINES,
	LOCAL_INCLUDES such that one can override CFLAGS from the command
	line without losing CPP search patchs and defines. Some associated
	Makefile cleanup. [from wsanchez@apple.com]

1999-09-21  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

	* ftp.c (getreply): Don't declare strpbrk or strstr functions if
	they're defined as macros.

1999-08-27  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* ftp.c: Diable krb5-mech2 for now.

Tue May 11 11:58:00 1999  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@mit.edu>

	* ftp.c: Inclusion of gssapi_krb5.h requires gssapi_generic.h.

Thu Feb 25 23:05:03 1999  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* secure.c (secure_putbuf): Revert Sam's last change; if
 	FUDGE_FACTOR is wrong, then badness can happen.  Also, if
 	out_buf.length != nbytes+FUDGE_FACTOR, heap corruption could
 	happen.  We really should be using gss_wrap_size_limit() or
 	something like that, but doing so would require substantial
 	amounts of reworking. [krb5-appl/685]

1998-11-13  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@rsts-11.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Set the myfulldir and mydir variables (which are
		relative to buildtop and thisconfigdir, respectively.)

1998-10-26  Marc Horowitz  <marc@mit.edu>

	* ftp.c (login): *always* encrypt the password, regardless
	of the default command mode.
	(do_auth): Try the new krb5 mech, and if that fails, try the
	old one.

1998-10-26  Geoffrey King  <gjking@mit.edu>

	* ftp.M: Add documentation for new ccc and cprotect commands.
	Also, add previously omitted command line options -u and -t and
	"passive" command to the man page.
	
	* main.c (main): Print out a usage message instead of just
	"unknown option."

Fri Oct  2 16:16:13 1998  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@mit.edu>

	* cmdtab.c: Update help message for passive mode so that it
 		indicates that the "passive" command toggles passive mode.

	* main.c (main): Make passive mode off by default.

Fri Aug 28 18:46:35 1998  Geoffrey King  <gjking@mit.edu>

	* cmds.c (user): Replace "oldlevel" with the more descriptive
	"oldclevel".  Also, replace all occurrences of "dlevel" in this
	function with "clevel".

	* ftp.c (login): Test whether or not the server actually requires
	"PASS dummy" by first sending "PWD" and checking the return value.
	
Wed Aug 12 02:26:26 1998  Geoffrey King  <gjking@mit.edu>

	* ftp.c, cmds.c, cmdtab.c, main.c, secure.c, ftp_var.h: Replace
 	global variable level with separate variables clevel and dlevel
 	for the control channel and data channel protection levels,
 	respectively, so that the user may specify separate protection
 	levels for each channel.  Similarly, functions such as getlevel
 	and setlevel are now getclevel/getdlevel, and setclevel/setdlevel.

	* cmdtab.c: Add new FTP commands "cprotect" to allow the user to 
	set the control channel protection level (similar to "protect"), 
	and "ccc" (Clear Command Channel) which sets the control channel
	protection level to clear (per the RFC).
	
Fri Aug  7 22:39:47 1998  Matthew D Hancher  <mdh@mit.edu>

	* ftp.c (do_auth): Make verbosity not disappear if GSSAPI fails.
	(getreply): Move 'S:' and 'P:' from verbose to debug.

Fri Aug  7 11:45:17 1998  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* ftp.c (getreply): Restore proper setting of safe.  This variable
	was previously being set to the value of code rather than to the
	boolean expression (code == 631), which it had been previously.
	The bug resulted in all replies from the server being parsed as
	krb_safe messages even when they were krb_priv messages.

1998-05-06  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@rsts-11.mit.edu>

	* radix.c (argv): POSIX states that getopt returns -1 when it
		is done parsing options, not EOF.

Sat Apr 25 01:53:04 1998  Sam Hartman  <hartmans@luminous.mit.edu>

	* cmds.c (setpeer): Fix so that autologin is respected again

1998-04-21  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@cygnus.com>

	* glob.c (ftpglob): Always allocate new storage, even if no magic
	glob characters were found, because the caller will always free
	the storage.

Tue Apr  7 16:53:58 1998  Dan Winship  <danw@mit.edu>

	* secure.c (secure_putbyte): Set nout = 0 *before* calling
 	secure_putbuf: if the transfer is aborted, the SIGURG handler will
 	longjmp out, so the line after the secure_putbuf will never get
 	executed, so nout would never be reset and the next transfer
 	would overrun ucbuf.

Wed Feb 18 15:29:35 1998  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Remove trailing slash from thisconfigdir.  Fix up
	BUILDTOP for new conventions.

Fri Feb 13 15:31:46 1998  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@rsts-11.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in (thisconfigdir), configure.in: Point the
 		configuration directory at our parent, and remove our
		local configure.in

Mon Feb  2 17:02:29 1998  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@rsts-11.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Define BUILDTOP and thisconfigdir in the Makefile

Thu Jan 29 19:39:27 1998  Dan Winship  <danw@mit.edu>

	* ftp.h:
	* ftp.M:
	* main.c (main): add options -f (forward credentials) and -x
	(automatically negotiate encryption)

	* ftp.c (do_auth): implement -f. Also, don't complain that
	ftp/hostname doesn't exist if host/hostname does.

	* cmds.c (setpeer): implement -x


Thu Dec 11 23:26:58 1997  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* ftp.c:
	* main.c: Don't include netdb.h or sys/socket.h if krb.h is
	included; this works around an Ultrix bug where those headers
	aren't protected against multiple inclusion.

Sat Dec  6 18:17:10 1997  Sam Hartman  <hartmans@luminous.mesas.com>

	* main.c (main): Add -u for unauthenticated

	* ftp_var.h: Add autoauth

	* cmds.c (setpeer): Automatic authentication should not be
 	dependent on autologin; use -u instead.


Thu Oct 16 01:20:30 1997  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* main.c: Change KERBEROS to KRB5_KRB4_COMPAT where appropriate.

	* secure.c: Use <secure.h> rather than "secure.h" so that the
	correct secure.h gets included (the one in the $(srcdir) of the
	directory we're compiling secure.c into).  From danw@mit.edu.

	* ftp.c: Change KERBEROS to KRB5_KRB4_COMPAT where appropriate.
	Re-order the clauses so that that GSSAPI gets tried before
	KERBEROS_V4.

	* Makefile.in: Update LOCALINCLUDE and the link line to DTRT with
	krb4 compatibility.

Sun Aug 17 14:23:39 1997  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in (SRCS): Add $(srcdir) where needed.

Wed Apr 30 14:59:03 1997  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@rsts-11.mit.edu>

	* cmds.c (getit): Fix Y2K bug in the parsing of the MDTM command.
		[krb5-appl/399]

Wed Feb  5 20:29:31 1997  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in:
	* configure.in: Update to new program build procedure.

Fri Nov 22 15:48:19 1996  unknown  <bjaspan@mit.edu>

	* ftp.c (hookup): use sizeof instead of h_length to determine
 	number of bytes of addr to copy from DNS response [krb5-misc/211]

Fri Sep 27 16:05:09 1996  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* cmds.c (setpeer): Apply jik's fix so "-n" actually works as
	intended.


Tue Sep 10 14:07:15 1996  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* ftp.M: remove ".so man1/header.doc"

Fri Aug 16 20:04:03 1996  Sam Hartman  <hartmans@mit.edu>

	* secure.c (nbyte;): Fix for Kerberos IV version of the memory
 	allocation bug I fixed for Kerberos V; you want nbyte +
 	FUDGE_FACTOR, not out_buff.length.

Tue Jul 30 19:45:45 1996  Samuel D Hartman  (hartmans@vorlon)

	* ftp.c (empt resety): Use fd_set as a typedef not a struct.
        Linux breaks.

Mon Jul 29 22:37:23 1996  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

	* secure.c: Do not assume sizeof(long) = 4 for sending lengths OTW

	* configure.in: Determine sizeof short, int, long for secure.c

Fri Jul 26 20:55:12 1996  Sam Hartman  <hartmans@tertius.mit.edu>

	* secure.c (secure_putbyte): Reset nout to zero on errorso we
        don't overflow our buffer.

	* ftp.c (sendrequest): If there is an error in secure_write, break
        out of the loop.

	* secure.c(FUDGE_FACTOR): Define for GSSAPI so writes don't fail.
        i chose a value of 64, which is larger than the apparent 52 bytes
        of additional data but I'm not sure 52 is constant.

	(secure_putbuf): Set bufsize to the size we actually allocate
	     Also, write foure bytes for net_len no matter how long it
	     actually is.  I would rather declare it a 32-bit type but am not
	     sure whether to use the GSSAPI, krb4, or krb5 32-bit int.

Wed Jul 10 16:40:19 1996  Marc Horowitz  <marc@mit.edu>

	* cmdtab.c (cmdtab[]), cmds.c (delete_file): rename delete() to
 	delete_file() to avoid conflict with the dbm delete() function

Thu Mar 28 21:07:40 1996  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@cygnus.com>

	* cmds.c (setpeer): Define unix for HP-UX.

Thu Mar 28 19:26:53 1996  Marc Horowitz  <marc@mit.edu>

	* secure.c (secure_putbuf): the size computation of the output
 	buffer was ok for krb4, but completely wrong for gssapi.  I moved
 	the code into the KERBEROS block, and wrote suitable code for
 	GSSAPI.  This affects the client and server, which were core
 	dumping on hpux.

Mon Mar 18 12:12:44 1996  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

	* secure.c, ftp.c, ftp_var.h: Define STDARG if HAVE_STDARG_H is
 		defined (in addition to the other tests)

		present for malloc declarations.

Thu Jan 18 18:33:18 1996  Sam Hartman  <hartmans@zygorthian-space-raiders.MIT.EDU>

	* cmds.c: Handle sys_errlist and remove declaration of errno.

	* configure.in: Check to see if we need to declare sys_errlist.

	* configure.in: Check for sys/select.h

	* ftp.c: Include sys/select.h if present.

Sun Jan 14 01:54:35 1996  Bill Schoofs <wjs@cray.com>

	* Makefile.in (DEFINES): define NOCONFIDENTIAL for future use.
	* ftp.c (command): recognize 533, not 402, for 'server unwilling
	to accept' 
	(getreply): recognize 633 for confidential reply, and then don't
	support it.
	
Tue Jan  2 19:17:47 1996  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* pclose.c: test HAVE_GETDTABLESIZE instead of hpux.
	* configure.in: set HAVE_GETDTABLESIZE.

	* configure.in: check for POSIX_TERMIOS just like appl/bsd does.

Wed Oct  4 19:24:39 1995  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* ftp, pclose, ruserpass.c, secure.c: don't ever declare malloc.

Sun Oct  1 03:30:30 1995  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* ftp.c (do_auth): accept ADAT 3yz response. Clean up loops, add
	lots of debugging messages.

Sun Oct  1 00:56:55 1995  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* Makefile.in: use FTP_BUFSIZ everywhere and make it large for
	now.
	* ftp.c: only look at "host" for now. Report error parsing
	name. Handle gssapi error reporting better.
	

Sat Sep 30 22:26:37 1995  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* ftp.c, secure.c: correct gssapi includes. Fix some typos and
	missing declarations.

	* Makefile.in (depend, install): change to double colon rules.
	* cmds.c: no conf.h, check HAVE_GETCWD, use krb5_sigtype.
	* configure.in: check KRB5_SIGTYPE, CHECK_SIGPROCMASK,
	CHECK_WAIT_TYPE, and getcwd.

	them to standard error.
	(secure_gss_error): hook for secure.c common functions to get the
	correct error routine.
	* getpass.c, main.c: no conf.h, use krb5_sigtype.
	* pclose.c: no conf.h, use krb5_sigtype.
	(mypclose): obey USE_SIGPROCMASK.

	implicit double, by doing the whole calculation in the variable.

Thu Feb  2 13:40:04 1995  Ian Lance Taylor  <ian@cygnus.com>

	* ftp.c: Don't try to use IP_TOS if the IP_TOS argument
	(IPTOS_LOWDELAY, etc.) is not defined.

	* cmds.c (setpeer): add || defined(linux) to the NBBY == 8 check,
	since this code is appropriate under linux.

	* ftp.c: If STDARG is defined, or if __STDC__ is defined and
	VARARGS is not defined, include <stdarg.h>, instead of

	VARARGS).
	(secure_error): Likewise.
