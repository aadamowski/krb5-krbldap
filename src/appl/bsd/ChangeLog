Fri Feb  2 16:10:56 1996  Sam Hartman  <hartmans@tertius.mit.edu>

	* configure.in (save_path): Look for "ucb" varients in /usr/athena/bin if --enable-athena specified.


	* krsh.c krlogin.c krcp.c (try_normal): If a--enable-athena, don't quit just because we are encrypted.

Thu Feb  1 00:09:13 1996  Sam Hartman  <hartmans@tertius.mit.edu>

	* rcp.M: Fix typo.

	* krcp.c (des_write): If rcp tries to write to stdin, redirect it
        to stdout.  That way it works with pipes; the right thing is for
        rcp to not try and do this, but introducing remread and remwrite
        as variables is significantly more work for only slightly better
        code.
	(main):  Use rsh encryption; not user-to-user. Note that we still
	support the answer_auth mechanism for incoming connections
	so older clients work, but this is depricated.
	(send_auth): expunged with pleasure; answer_auth should go in a
	a version or two.

Wed Jan 31 16:24:50 1996  Sam Hartman  <hartmans@tertius.mit.edu>

	* krsh.c (main): Print SECURE_MESSAGE when appropriate.

	* krshd.c (doit): Fork and handle pipes either if stderr signal
        processing is enabled *or* encryption is enabled.  Rsh always
        enables stderr, but rcp won't.
	(SECURE_MESSAGE): Moving to client where it belongs, so the stderr
	lchannel doesn't get corrupted for rcp.  Besides, the client can determine if it is talking to a tty and only print this message to a tty.

	* krlogind.c (recvauth): Pas ccache to rd_and_store_for_creds

	* krshd.c (recvauth): Pass address of ccache to rd_and_store_for_creds
	(ccache): new global variable.
	(cleanup): Destroy ccache if we have one.
	(doit): Destroy cache on normal terination.

	* forward.c (rd_and_store_for_creds): Take a pointer to a ccache;
        we should provide the caller with a way of destroying forwarded
        credentials.

Tue Jan 30 17:56:49 1996  Sam Hartman  <hartmans@tertius.mit.edu>

	* krshd.c (envinit): Expand to have space KRB5_CCNAME
	(doit): Put krb5_ccname at the end of envinit; this is
	handled differently that other variables, because TZ may or may not
	beset, so our position cannot be fixed.


Sat Jan 27 18:40:31 1996  Sam Hartman  <hartmans@tertius.mit.edu>

	* kcmd.c (kcmd): We no longer need F_SETOWN as nothing in appl/bsd
        handles oob data with signals any more.

Fri Jan 26 00:37:23 1996  Sam Hartman  <hartmans@tertius.mit.edu>

	* krlogin.c (endif
): 
(reader):  Deal with exceptions even while writing.
(reader): Fix bogus select bug; actually select on writing

Wed Jan 24 00:34:42 1996  Sam Hartman  <hartmans@tertius.mit.edu>

	* krlogind.M krshd.M: Update to document new options.

	* Makefile.in (install): Install as kshd and klogind not krshd and
 	krlogind.

	* krshd.c (main): Use krlogind-style options (-54kce)

	* krlogind.c (main): Change option parsing  to support new format.
	(do_krb_login): Use auth_ok and auth_sent masks instead of passed_*

Tue Jan 23 18:10:55 1996  Sam Hartman  <hartmans@tertius.mit.edu>

	* krshd.c (recvauth): Use the correct username in strlen call for
        allocating chksumbuf.

	* krlogind.c (recvauth): Code to copy checksum verification code.


Mon Jan 22 15:14:11 1996  Sam Hartman  <hartmans@tertius.mit.edu>

	* krshd.c (recvauth): Update to expect port in checksum.

	* kcmd.c (kcmd): Include port in string of checksumed data to
 	distinguish between encrypted and unencrypted rlogin.


Mon Jan 22 18:14:05 1996  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

	* krcp.c: Use KRB5_STDARG_P.

	* configure.in: Add KRB5_CHECK_PROTOS for prototyps definitions.


Fri Jan 19 10:45:29 1996  Sam Hartman  <hartmans@tertius.mit.edu>

	* krshd.c (recvauth): Verify checksum against command line and remote user.
	(recvauth): Fix accidental memory leak with authenticator and fix
	include correct username in checksum

	* kcmd.c: Send authenticator with checksum of command line and remote user.

	* krlogin.c (des_read): Return 0 or -1 on close/error respectively.

Wed Jan 17 15:14:33 1996  Sam Hartman  <hartmans@tertius.mit.edu>

	* krlogin.c ((reader): Use select to find out-of-band data, not signals.
	(oob): No longer a signal handler; just a function.
	(writer): get rid of copytochild setup as sigurg no longer needed
	(main): Don't block SIGURG
	* configure.in :  Include sys/time.h check

Mon Jan 15 16:16:07 1996  Sam Hartman  <hartmans@tertius.mit.edu>

	* login.c (main): ttyslot usable here as well

	* krlogind.c (doit): update_utmp can use ttyslot.

Thu Jan 11 12:40:08 1996  Ezra Peisach  (epeisach@paris)

	* krsh.c, krlogin.c: (main): Ultrix cc does not support automatic
		aggregate initiailzation of structures. 

Thu Jan 11 11:27:04 1996  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

	* krcp.c (error): Convert to use varargs.

	* configure.in: Check for stdarg.h

Wed Jan 10 21:26:20 1996  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* kcmd.c (getport): Clear the sin structure to be zero.  (From
		Doug Engbert.)

	* krsh.c (main): Added code to default port to 544 if service not
	        found.  (From Doug Engbert.)

	* krlogin.c (main): Added code to default port to 543 or 2105 if
	        service not found.  (From Doug Engbert.)

	* login.c (main): Save KRB5CCNAME environment variable, which may
	        have been set by forward.c.  Add code for SGI to set
	        environment for its /etc/TIMEZONE (untested).  Don't print
	        MOTD twice on Suns, added #ifdef NO_MOTD.  (Patches from
		Doug Engbert).

	* kcmd.c: Removed extern global of krb5_kdc_req_sumtype, which
		wasn't being used anyway.

Tue Jan  9 22:51:16 1996  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* forward.c (get_for_creds): Removed no longer used function.

	* kcmd.c (kcmd): Convert from using get_for_creds() from forward.c
		to using the official library routine, krb5_fwd_tgt_creds().

Fri Dec 22 17:42:11 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* login.c (main): If HAVE_SHADOW is defined, and no shadow
		password entry is availble, try using the password entry
		in the password file.

Tue Dec 19 17:11:37 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* kcmd.c: Also include unistd.h, if it's available.

Tue Dec  5 20:44:39 1995  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

	* configure.in: Use krb5util library.

	* login.c (main): Change two-argument call to syslog to three
		arguments to handle screw cases in hostnames.

Fri Dec  1 17:25:02 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* login.c (main, dofork): Applied patch from Scott Schwartz
	        <schwartz@galapagos.cse.psu.edu>

		Under SunOS, and maybe other systems, there is a a problem
		with krlogind.c and a similar problem with login.c as
		distributed with K5.5.

		The bug is that rlogind forks a child but retains a
		controlling tty.  If the child is in the same process
		group as the parent, which is will if you don't use a job
		control shell (chsh /bin/rc), keyboard signals will kill
		the daemon.  telnetd dissociates itself properly, but then
		login.krb5 waits for the shell to finish, but login.krb5
		has the same ctty as the shell and is in the same process
		group, so it has the same problem.

		In BSD you used to be able to give up your ctty at will,
		but SunOS seems to have setsid as the only mechanism to
		perform that action, and setsid can only succeed in
		limited circumstances.  Rlogind ought to be fixed to
		behave more like telnetd, but independent of that,
		login.krb5 needs to be patched if kerberos is to work
		properly under SunOS.

Sun Nov 12 12:39:23 1995  Sam Hartman  <hartmans@tertius.mit.edu>

	* krlogind.c (doit): Clear iextn for NetBSD and other 4.4-based
        systems so that ctrl-o isn't special.

Sat Oct 21 17:33:37 1995  Sam Hartman  <hartmans@tertius.mit.edu>

	* login.c (main): Don't set LOGNAME twice.

Sun Nov 12 04:44:50 1995  Mark W. Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* krshd.c (doit): drag TZ= from parent environment into envinit to
	pass to child.
	(envinit, TZENV): add one more slot for optional TZ, and mark it.

Thu Nov  2 16:16:47 1995  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

	* krlogin.c, krcp.c, krsh.c (main): If invoked with -D port, do
		not die if entry is missing from /etc/services.

Mon Oct 16 17:27:43 1995  Sam Hartman  <hartmans@tertius.mit.edu>

	* login.c (main): Don't print warning about no tickets obtained if we didn't ask for a password.  Also, define LOGNAME for so sysvish systems are happy.  Patch from ramus@nersc.gov.

Wed Sep 06 14:20:57 1995   Chris Provenzano (proven@mit.edu)

        * krcp.c, krlogin.c, krlogind.c, krsh.c, krshd.c : 
		s/keytype/enctype/g, s/KEYTYPE/ENCTYPE/g

Sun Aug 27 15:35:04 1995  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

	* rlogin.M: Document -f and -F options.

Mon Aug  7 17:32:29 1995  Sam Hartman  <hartmans@tertius.mit.edu>

	* krlogind.c: Close the write side of the syncpipe in the parent
        so we get SIGPIPE if child dies. 

	* login.c (main): Use new interface to pty_update_utmp

	* configure.in (LOGINLIBS): Check for utmp.h and utmpx.h.

	* krlogind.c (doit): Use new format for pty_update_utmp
	* Include utmp.h because libpty.h no longer does.

Fri Aug  4 00:50:41 1995  Tom Yu  <tlyu@dragons-lair.MIT.EDU>

	* krlogind.c: don't include utmp.h, since libty.h grabs it.

Wed Aug  2 13:06:02 1995  Sam Hartman  <hartmans@tertius.mit.edu>

	* krlogind.c (main): call pty_init()call pty_init()

Tue Aug  1 08:43:22 1995  Sam Hartman  <hartmans@tertius.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in :  Remove references to logutil.c and logutil.o


	* krshd.c (doit): Replace logwtmp with pty_logwtmp

	* login.c (main): use pty_update_utmp not update_utmp

	* logutil.c: Removed because all its functionality is incorperated
        into libpty.

	* krlogind.c (doit): Pass length of line to pty_getpty

Mon Jul 31 17:07:59 1995  Sam Hartman  <hartmans@tertius.mit.edu>

	* login.c (main): Don't call TIOCSETD under Posix.
	 * Include iexten in terminal flags.


	* krlogin.c:  Don't include termio.h here either.

	* login.c: Remove special casing of AIX to include termio.h; it
        breaks almost all terminal handling, because it's the
        compatibility file for applications written for the RT.  Instead,
        just define CNUL if not already defined by ttychars.h


Sat Jul 29 04:37:33 1995  Tom Yu  <tlyu@dragons-lair.MIT.EDU>

	* configure.in: Don't link with -lkadm


Fri Jul 28 16:49:02 1995  Sam Hartman  <hartmans@tertius.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in (LOCAL_LIBRARIES): include -lpty; also included in
        DEPLOCAL_LIBRARIES.

	* krlogind.c (doit): Use pipe for synchronization so pty can be opened in slave.  Use libpty for pty handling.
	(cleanup):  Use pty_cleanup to do most work.

Thu Jul 27 15:02:03 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* krshd.c - Check for interrupted select.  Should fix bug #1555.


Thu Jul 13 17:49:54 1995  Sam Hartman  <hartmans@tertius.mit.edu>

	* configure.in : Short circuit the streams test for AIX to false
        because AIX strops.h trashes definition of _IO from sys/ioctl.h.
        I think this is fixed in AIX4, so the test is only bypassed for
        AIX3.

Tue Jul 11 12:50:16 1995  Sam Hartman  <hartmans@tertius.mit.edu>

	* krlogind.c (getpty): Use ptsname before ttyname; it has a higher
        chance of doing what we want.

Fri Jul 7 15:40:42 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* Makefile.in - Remove all explcitit library handling.
	* configure.in - Add USE_<mumble> and KRB5_LIBRARIES.

Wed Jul  5 20:03:37 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* krcp.c, krlogin.c, krlogind.c, krshd.c, login.c: Remove
		declaration of errno altoghether.  "extern int errno;" is
		always wrong.

	* login.c (main): Don't use the TIOCLSET ioctl unless we're not
		using POSIX_TERMIOS.  Don't just blindly set the file
		status flags to 0.  Instead, do a fcntl(0, F_GETFL), and
		then reset the nonblocking flags.

Sun Jul  2 19:48:27 1995  Sam Hartman  <hartmans@tertius.mit.edu>

	* krcp.c: make errno extern

	* krshd.c: errno should be extern so it doesn't mask the libc
        definition in AIX.

Tue Jun 27 23:50:56 1995  Tom Yu  (tlyu@dragons-lair)

	* krlogin.c: don't redeclare noltc, defltc if we happen to have
		TIOCGLTC in addition to POSIX_TERMIOS

Tue Jun 27 16:18:49 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* configure.in - When checking number/type of arguments to {get,set}pgrp
		attempt to set __STDC__ in a vain attempt to ensure that we
		get function prototype checking turned on.  OSF/1's native
		compiler didn't really care what's passed as arguments unless
		__STDC__'s set.
	* krcp.c - Change usage of BUFSIZ to RCP_BUFSIZ.  Remove & from in
		front of array.  It's redundant.
	* krlogin.c - Change usage of BUFSIZ to RLOGIN_BUFSIZ.  Add signal
		name parameter to signal handlers to conform to prototype.
	* krlogind.c - Change usage of BUFSIZ to RLOGIND_BUFSIZ.  Cast 4th
		argument to setsockopt(2) to be const char *.
	* krsh.c - Change usage of BUFSIZ to RSH_BUFSIZ.  Cast 4th argument
		to setsockopt(2) to be const char *.
	* krshd.c - Change usage of BUFSIZ to RSHD_BUFSIZ.

Thu Jun 22 14:36:46 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* configure.in: Change AC_HAVE_HEADERS with AC_CHECK_HEADERS, and
		check for string.h as well.

	* krsh.c: Don't include ext-proto.h; move the #include of the
		header files which we actually needed into krsh.c, using
		the autoconf standard define's.

Wed Jun 21 17:29:27 1995  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

	* login.c: Change RETSIGTYPE to krb5_sigtype to be consistant.

	* configure.in (LOGINLIBS): Add KRB5_SIGTYPE to declare krb5_sigtype.

Tue Jun 20 13:00:25 1995  Tom Yu  (tlyu@dragons-lair)

	* krlogin.c: HAS_STDLIB_H -> HAVE_STDLIB_H

Mon Jun 19 13:34:23 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* login.c - Change setluid call to check for luid and then set it if
		it fails, also make this logic conditional under HAVE_SETLUID.
	* configure.in - For OSF/1 systems where libsecurity is present, set
		HAVE_SETLUID.  We'll need to determine similar tests for other
		extended security systems that we are to support in the future.


Thu Jun 15 17:32:20 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* Makefile.in - Change explicit library names to -l<lib> form, and
		change target link line to use $(LD) and associated flags.
		Also, remove DBMLIB, it was not used. Also, for K4, use
		KRB4_LIB and KRB4_CRYPTO_LIB, these were
                split out.
	* configure.in - Remove dbm library checks, these are no longer needed
		with the Berkeley database code.  Also, add shared library
		usage check.

Sat Jun 10 22:56:10 1995  Tom Yu  (tlyu@dragons-lair)

	* forward.c, kcmd.c, krcp.c, krlogind.c, krshd.c:
		krb5_auth_context redefinitions

Fri Jun  9 18:26:30 1995    <tytso@rsx-11.mit.edu>

	* configure.in: Remove standardized set of autoconf macros, which
		are now handled by CONFIG_RULES.

Wed May 31 17:16:44 1995  Tom Yu  (tlyu@dragons-lair)

	* loginpaths.h: #ifdef ultrix => #ifdef __ultrix

Sun May 21 16:36:39 1995  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

	* loginpaths.h: Add NetBSD paths.

	* login.c: Define TAB3 to 0 if non existant

	* krlogin.c (mode): ifdef code based on TABDLY existing on
		machine. (netbsd lacks this).

	* krcp.c: Declare sys_errlist only if needed by the OS.

	* configure.in: Add DECLARE_SYS_ERRLIST
		Check for libcrypt defining the function crypt

Mon May 15 10:43:30 1995    <tytso@rsx-11.mit.edu>

	* login.c (main): Only try to use TIOCSETD if it is defined
		(instead of relying on _IBMR2 *not* being defined).

		Only try to use TIOCNXCL if it is defined.

	* krcp.c: If setreuid() is emulated using setresuid(),
		#define HAVE_SETREUID so it gets used.

Sat May 13 08:59:38 1995  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

	* krshd.c (recvauth): Use krb5_auth_con_genaddrs to set the port
		on the connection so that credential forwarding works.

Tue May  9 08:17:18 1995  Ezra Peisach  (epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu)

	* krshd.c (main): Cast a sockaddr_in * to sockaddr * in call to
		accept. 

	* kcmd.c: Add <stdlib.h>

	* krcp.c: Add <stdlib.h>.

Sat May  6 18:12:37 1995  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

	* krcp.c (answer_auth): Added const declaration to filenames.

Fri May 05 09:16:16 1995  Chris Provenzano (proven@mit.edu)

	* krcp.c (answer_auth()): Requires two new args that are passed
		from the command line. The first -c is to pass the filename
		of the remote credential cache. The second -C is to pass
		the filename of the remote krb5.conf file.

Thu May 04 23:53:23 1995  Chris Provenzano (proven@mit.edu)

	* krcp.c (answer_auth()): Don't destroy the credential cache.

Wed May 03 20:10:39 1995  Chris Provenzano (proven@mit.edu)

	* krcp.c (answer_auth()): Set auth_context = NULL before using it.

Wed May 03 03:30:51 1995  Chris Provenzano (proven@mit.edu)

        * krlogind.c, krshd.c: (krb5_compat_recvauth()): 
		No longer needs the rc_type arg.

Tue May  2 22:12:39 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* krcp.c (main): Don't try to play uid swapping games if the
		effective uid is not zero.

	* kcmd.c (kcmd): Bug fix to jik's bug fix.  (Caused by our code
		drift since jik's changes went in, and not sufficiently
		careful checking of jik's patches before applying it.)

Mon May 01 15:56:32 1995  Chris Provenzano

	* kcmd.c (kcmd()): Bug fixes from jik.

	* krlogind.c (recvauth()): Changes to auth_context to better 
		support full addresses, for rd_cred() and friends.

Sat Apr 29 01:26:06 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* Makefile.in (login.krb5): Link the libraries twice due to
		circular dependency in the libraries.  (read_password in
		libdes425.a depends on krb5_read_password in libkrb5.a)

Fri Apr 28 20:33:06 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* login.c (main): Don't use setreuid() to play games with the real
		uid, since not all systems have setreuid().  This method
		of communicating to in_tkt what the correct owner of the
		ticket file is completely broken, anyway.  We skip the
		setreuid() entirely, and then chown the ticket file to the
		correct owner and group afterwards.

Fri Apr 28 17:59:19 1995  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* Makefile.in (KLIB): include KRB4_LIB directly, to satisfy both
	versions of the dependencies.

Fri Apr 28 16:55:14 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* Makefile.in	- change position of KRB4_LIB for krshd and krlogind
			  so that it links correctly for both --with-krb4
			  and --with-krb4=/usr/athena.

Fri Apr 28 16:12:57 1995  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* configure.in (PATH): use internal AC_PROG_ECHO_N because change
	in path might change behavior of echo (example: solaris, native
	shell, with GNU echo (-n) in user path, but only Solaris echo (\c)
	in path here.)

Fri Apr 28 07:52:45 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@lurch.mit.edu>

	* login.c: Lots of lint cleanup; declare functions before they
		are used, add appropriate return types (int or void)
		to functions as necessary, etc.
	
Thu Apr 27 21:44:17 1995  Ezra Peisach  (epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu)

	* login.c: Remove definition of krb_err_txt. krb.h defines it.

Thu Apr 27 17:41:06 1995  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* Makefile.in (krshd, login.krb5, krlogind): KRB4_LIB needs to
	appear before KLIB since it uses des425.

Thu Apr 27 14:36:54 1995  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* Makefile.in (LOCALINCLUDE): get kerberosIV headers for login.c
	(login.krb): link against krb4 libs.
	* configure.in: check AC_CONST so it works.

Thu Apr 27 13:54:21 1995  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* configure.in: use WITH_KRB4 as-is.
	* Makefile.in (krshd, krlogind): use KRB4_LIB directly.

Thu Apr 27 01:09:19 1995  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

	* krcp.c (answer_auth): Should not call krb5_cc_close after
		krb5_cc_destroy. (encrypted rcp failed).

	* krlogind.c (main): -S option was not getting a keytab. (passing
		a char * to krb5_compat_recvauth).

	* krshd.c (recvauth): extract the client principal from ticket
		before calling krb5_kuserok on a NULL principal.
		(main): -S option was not getting a keytab (passing a char *).

	(for sunos.)

Thu Oct 27 16:12:19 1994  Mark Eichin  (eichin@cygnus.com)

		returned by kcmd to the caller!

	* configure.in
	* krlogin.c (des_write): Don't check for srand48 and then try to
