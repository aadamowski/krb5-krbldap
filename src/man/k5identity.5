.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fB~/.k5identity\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
The \fI.k5identity\fP  file, which resides in a user\(aqs home directory,
contains a list of rules for selecting a client principals based on
the server being accessed. These rules are used to choose a credential
cache within the cache collection when possible.
.sp
Blank lines and lines beginning with \(aq#\(aq are ignored.  Each line has the form:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
principal field=value ...
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If the server principal meets all of the field constraints, then principal
is chosen as the client principal.  The following fields are recognized:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBrealm\fP
.sp
If the realm of the server principal is known, it is matched
against \fIvalue\fP, which may be a pattern using shell wildcards.
For host\-based server principals, the realm will generally only
be known if there is a \fIdomain_realm\fP section
in \fIkrb5.conf\fP with a mapping for the hostname.
.TP
.B \fBservice\fP
.sp
If the server principal is a host\-based principal,
its service component is matched against \fIvalue\fP, which may be
a pattern using shell wildcards.
.TP
.B \fBhost\fP
.sp
If the server principal is a host\-based principal,
its hostname component is converted to lower case and matched
against \fIvalue\fP, which may be a pattern using shell wildcards.
.sp
If  the server principal matches the constraints of multiple lines
in the .k5identity file, the principal from the first matching line is used.
If no line  matches, credentials will be selected some other way,
such as the realm heuristic or the current primary cache.
.UNINDENT
.SH EXAMPLE
.sp
The following example .k5identity file selects the client principal
alice@KRBTEST.COM if the server principal is within that realm,
the principal alice/root@EXAMPLE.COM if the server host is within
a servers subdomain, and the principal alice/mail@EXAMPLE.COM
when accessing the IMAP service on mail.example.com:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
alice@KRBTEST.COM       realm=KRBTEST.COM
alice/root@EXAMPLE.COM  host=*.servers.example.com
alice/mail@EXAMPLE.COM  host=mail.example.com service=imap
.ft P
