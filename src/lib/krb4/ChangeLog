Wed May 22 07:41:15 1996  Sam Hartman  <hartmans@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in (install-unix): Don't include an install rule, as it

Sun Nov 12 05:26:08 1995  Mark W. Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* g_cnffile.c (krb__get_srvtabname): new function, looks up
	[libdefaults]krb4_srvtab for use where KEYFILE used to be.
	* g_cnffile.c (krb__v5_get_file): new function, looks up argument
	in [libdefaults] and tries to open it as a filename. Returns
	filehandle (or NULL, if fopen failed.)
	(krb__get_cnffile, krb__get_realmsfile): use krb__v5_get_file to
	look up "krb4_config" or "krb4_realms" respectively. Also add
	$KRB_REALMS override for realms file.

Mon Oct  2 11:12:05 1995  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

	* configure.in (V5_MAKE_SHARED_LIB): Change rule to install

		files, instead of $(NETIO_OBJS)

	* tf_util.c (utimes): If __SVR4 is defined, #include <utime.h>,
		just as we do if __svr4__ is defined.

	* g_pw_in_tkt.c: If __SVR4 is defined, #include <sgtty.h>, just as
		we do if __svr4__ is defined.  (WARNING: This code still
		assumes that the BSD ioctl's are being supported, at least
		in compatibility mode.  We should really upgrade this code
		to use POSIX termios calls.)

Tue Jun 27 23:59:28 1995  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* rd_req.c (krb_rd_req): from_addr is an address, so use unsigned
	KRB4_32 instead of long.

        libraries


Fri Jun 16 11:15:45 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* Makefile.in - Change "./DONE" to "DONE" since we know how to make
		"DONE", hence a clean make won't get confused any more.

Thu Jun 15 18:07:24 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* Makefile.in - Add definitions for shared library build rules.

	* cr_err_repl.c (cr_err_reply): Remove backward compatibility code
		for Kerberos V3 (!) which was causing problems for shared
		libraries.  Library code shouldn't try to reference global
		variables defined by the calling application!

Sun May 21 16:06:20 1995  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

	* dest_tkt.c: If O_SYNC is not defined, define as 0.

	* in_tkt.c: If O_SYNC is not defined, define as 0.

Thu May 18 14:43:51 1995  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

	* in_tkt.c: Use HAVE_SETREUID and HAVE_SETRESUID to define 
		setreuid properly.

Thu May  4 10:03:22 1995  Tom Yu  (tlyu@dragons-lair)

	* put_svc_key.c (put_svc_key): remove spurious & in front of fkey
		(it's a char[] and takint address of it is redundant)

	* recvauth.c (krb_recvauth): remove spurious & in front of
		reference to kdata->session

	* rd_req.c (krb_rd_req): remove spurious & in front of reference
		to ad->session

	* g_in_tkt.c(decrypt_tkt): remove spurious & in front of reference
		to key (it is a C_Block and taking address of it is
		redundant)

	* Makefile.in: new includes target to install krb_err.h in
		$(BUILDTOP)/include; includes depends on krb_err.h.
		Previously, it was attempting to install a header that had
		not yet been generated!

	* configure.in: test for HAVE_STRSAVE (for kparse.c).

Fri Apr 28 01:38:42 1995  Mark W. Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* configure.in: use AC_CHECK_SIZEOF(int) to set BITS16/BITS32.
	Use AC_TRY_RUN test to set MSBFIRST or LSBFIRST.

Tue Mar 28 09:19:23 1995  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* send_to_kdc.c (send_to_kdc): only use secondary port if entry
	for primary doesn't have an explicit port number. Secondary port
	is still guessed to be 750. Also *don't* switch to the secondary
	port in general, since we might be using multiple realms.

Tue Feb 14 23:24:50 1995  John Gilmore  <gnu@cygnus.com>

	* sendauth.c (krb_net_rd_sendauth):  Result is a Kerberos error
	code, not an errno.

Mon Feb  6 16:11:52 1995  John Gilmore  (gnu at toad.com)

	* mac_store.c (DeleteServerMap):  When skipping a realm map, skip
	also the admin-flag byte; else walking the list of strings gets
	very confused. 

	* mac_stubs.c (kdriver):  Rename static variable to mac_stubs_kdriver,
	and export it to callers.
	(krb_get_ticket_for_service):  Circumvent MPW compiler bug that
	doesn't like array->memb inside a sizeof.  array[0].memb works.

Wed Feb 1 12:00:00 1995  John Rivlin  <jrivlin@cygnus.com>

	* Makefile.in: Modify install-windows and clean-windows
	targets to install libraries into src/windows directory.

Tue Jan 24 10:35:31 1995  Ian Lance Taylor  <ian@sanguine.cygnus.com>

Mon Jan 23 17:06:10 1995  Ian Lance Taylor  <ian@sanguine.cygnus.com>

	* g_pw_in_tkt.c (passwd_to_key): When not _WINDOWS or macintosh,
	restore code to call des_read_password if passwd is NULL.
	(krb_get_pw_in_tkt): Only error out if password is NULL if
	_WINDOWS or macintosh.

	* g_krbhst.c (get_krbhst_default): New static function.
	(krb_get_krbhst): Use get_krbhst_default.

Fri Jan 20 12:00:00 1995  John Rivlin  (jrivlin@fusion.com)

	* Makefile.in: Changed libentry to debug in link command as
	libentry is no longer provided in the Visual C++ environment.
	Libentry is part of the library in Visual C++.  Debug is used
	purely to satisfy the syntax requirements of the link command.

Thu Jan 19 14:18:10 1995  Ian Lance Taylor  <ian@sanguine.cygnus.com>

	* sendauth.c (krb_net_rd_sendauth): If the raw ticket length looks
	like the start of a warning from SunOS4 ld.so, just ignore the
	warning message, and look for the ticket after it.

Mon Jan 16 16:11:21 1995  John Gilmore  <gnu@cygnus.com>

	* kuserok.c (kuserok):  Allow realm to be defaulted in the
	~/.klogin file; this simplfies DejaGnu testing of Kerberos.
	Fix bug that left kname_parse arguments uninitialized. 

Mon Jan 16 11:54:01 1995  Ian Lance Taylor  <ian@sanguine.cygnus.com>

	* krb_err.et: Change KRBET_RD_APTIME message from ``delta_t too
	big'' to ``time is out of bounds.''

	* send_to_kdc.c: If POSIX, include <stdlib.h> instead of declaring
	malloc, calloc, and realloc.
	(cached_krb_udp_port): Make static.
	(send_to_kdc): If send_recv fails, and the kerberos port number
	used is from getservbyname, and is not 750, then try sending to
	port 750.

	* realmofhost.c (krb_realmofhost): If DO_REVERSE_RESOLVE is
	defined, canonicalize using gethostbyaddr.

Thu Jan 12 17:40:26 1995  Ian Lance Taylor  <ian@sanguine.cygnus.com>

	* in_tkt.c (in_tkt): Set umask to 077 around creation of ticket
	file to ensure that it is created with write access, even if the
	user has a screwy umask value.

Thu Dec 29 23:59:49 1994  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* g_in_tkt.c (krb_get_in_tkt_preauth): factored out into
	krb_mk_in_tkt_preauth and krb_parse_in_tkt. This simplifies the
	SNK4 support on platforms that can't do callbacks from (shared)
	libraries.

Tue Dec 27 11:12:54 1994  Ian Lance Taylor  <ian@cygnus.com>

	* g_in_tkt.c (krb_get_in_tkt_preauth): Rewrite switch statement to
	work when compiled by SCO 3.2v4 native C compiler.
	* g_ad_tkt.c (get_ad_tkt): Likewise.

Fri Dec 23 15:47:20 1994  Ian Lance Taylor  <ian@sanguine.cygnus.com>

	* memcache.c (unix): Define if _AIX is defined (AIX compiler does
	not predefine unix).

Fri Dec 16 18:57:40 1994  Ian Lance Taylor  <ian@sanguine.cygnus.com>

	* memcache.h: Use PROTOTYPE in declarations.
	* memcache.c: Rewrite function definitions to use Classic C
	parameter repetition rather than prototypes.

Thu Dec 15 18:23:37 1994  Ian Lance Taylor  <ian@sanguine.cygnus.com>

	* memcache.c: Add typedefs and macro definitions to make this file
	compile on Unix as well as on Windows and the Mac.

Wed Dec 14 19:31:24 1994  Ian Lance Taylor  <ian@sanguine.cygnus.com>

	* g_in_tkt.c (krb_get_in_tkt_preauth): Comment out assignment to
	exp_date, since it is not used.

Wed Nov 23 12:30:49 1994  Ian Lance Taylor  <ian@sanguine.cygnus.com>

	* fakeenv.c (_findenv, unsetenv): New functions, copied in from
	setenv.c.  The telnet server uses unsetenv.

Wed Nov 23 00:53:10 1994  John Gilmore  (gnu@cygnus.com)

	* realmofhost.c (krb_realmofhost):  Allow arbitrary host
	names here, as in krb_get_phost, by canonicalizing the name
	into a fully qualified name using gethostbyname().  This
	has the effect of letting users not set the "local realm"
	config knob in more cases, since a name without a dot will
	be canonicalized and searched-for in the domain-to-realm
	database, rather than being assumed to be in the local realm.
	This problem was found by using unqualified hostnames in Wintel.

Wed Nov 23 00:26:17 1994  John Gilmore  (gnu@cygnus.com)

	Clean up a few misleading error messages.

	* memcache.c (krb_get_tf_fullname):  Return NO_TKT_FIL if
	there are no tickets cached, just like from tf_util.c.
	* g_ad_tkt.c (get_ad_ticket):  If we try cross-realm 
	authentication, and it fails for lack of a key in the
	kerberos database, return AD_NOTGT ("No ticket-
	granting ticket") rather than KDC_PR_UNKNOWN ("Principal unknown").
	* krb_err.et, err_txt.c:  Update NO_TKT_FIL error message from
	"No ticket file (tf_util)" to "You have no tickets cached".

Thu Nov 17 12:31:27 1994  Ian Lance Taylor  <ian@sanguine.cygnus.com>

	* mk_preauth.c (krb_mk_preauth): des_key_sched takes a des_cblock
	argument, not des_cblock *, so remove the cast.
	* rd_preauth.c (krb_rd_preauth): Likewise.

Wed Nov 16 22:13:28 1994  Mark Eichin  (eichin@cygnus.com)

	* mk_preauth.c (krb_mk_preauth): use des_key_sched instead; check
	its return value and fail if it fails.
	* rd_preauth.c (krb_rd_preauth): ditto.

Wed Nov 16 17:35:07 1994  Mark Eichin  (eichin@cygnus.com)

	* mk_preauth.c (krb_mk_preauth): add R3 implementation (and
	NOENCRYPTION version) which passes encrypted aname.
	(krb_free_preauth): free storage from both implementations.

Wed Nov 16 17:28:14 1994  Mark Eichin  (eichin@cygnus.com)

	* g_pw_in_tkt.c (stub_key): use memcpy, in case the C_Block is an
	array and not a struct.

Wed Nov  9 12:45:02 1994  Ian Lance Taylor  <ian@sanguine.cygnus.com>

	* in_tkt.c: Fix thinko in last change.

Fri Nov  4 12:05:57 1994  Ian Lance Taylor  <ian@sanguine.cygnus.com>

Fri Nov  4 02:10:58 1994  John Gilmore  (gnu@cygnus.com)

	Make it build on MS-Windows again.

	* Makefile.in (NETIO_SRCS, NETIO_OBJS):  Break out, since these
	are required on MS-Windows and prohibited on Mac.
	(kerberos.dll):  Avoid line-length problems by copying 
	libraries from other directories and using very short names.

Tue Nov  1 15:47:44 1994  Ian Lance Taylor  <ian@sanguine.cygnus.com>

	* dest_tkt.c: Include "krb.h" before <stdio.h>.

	match function definition.

Wed Oct 12 00:37:46 1994  Julia Menapace  (jcm at toad.com)

	* Password.c: Include kerberos.h not Krb.h.  Define KRB_DEFS to
	avoid multiple symbol definitions from krb_driver.h.  Needs further
	cleanup but not just before release.

Mon Oct 10 20:07:56 1994  Julia Menapace  (jcm at toad.com)

	* g_tkt_svc.c: (cacheInitialTicket) moved to new file Password.c

	* mac_glue.c:  Remove superfluous comment.

	* mac_stubs.c: Add code translating unix function call to mac
	driver control call for krb_get_tf_fullname

	* macsock.c: Remove superflous comment.

	* memcache.c: Remove unused #includes
	(krb_get_tf_realm) pass tktfile instead of blank to
	krb_get_tf_fullname.

	(get_tf_fullname): Because the symantics of GetNthCredentials
	(called by this routine) were changed to disable multiple named
	caches (for UNIX compatability) we have to replace the user name
	and instance it returns with the actual name and instance of the
	current cache, set by in_tkt and stored in file static global
	variables.

Mon Oct 10 13:37:34 1994  Julia Menapace  (jcm at toad.com)

	* mk_auth.c:  New file, created from sendauth.c.  Contains just
	the portable parts of sendauth.c (krb_mk_auth and krb_check_auth).

	warnings with prototypes active.

	* kerberos.def: Added des_ecb_encrypt to externals for telnet.

Wed Sep 14 12:58:05 1994  Julia Menapace  (jcm@cygnus.com)

	* mac_stubs.c (krb_get_err_text): make return type const.
	(GetNthRealmMap): add routine to stubs library to generate a
	driver call returning the Nth Realm mapping.
	(GetNthServerMap): add routine to stubs library to generate a
	driver call returning the Nth server mapping.
	* g_tkt_svc.c (CacheInitialTicket): If user name has changed save
	it.
	* memcache.c (krb_save_credentials): Fill in credential with
	currently authorized user name and instance expected by kerberos,
	(passed to and stored by in_tkt) instead of FIXED user name and

	changes. Also changed all calls to above routine throughout 
	memcache.c.

	* netwrite.c: use newly added SOCKET_READ and SOCKET_EINTR values

	the krb.realms file so that the routine can be overridden
	in Windows implementation with a routine which looks up
	the name of the realms file in the kerberos.ini file.

	* win_store.c: Created to parallel the Mac implementation.
	Routines in this file will provide access to the krb.conf,
	krb.realms files and other configuration information.

	* ren.msg: Created entry for win_store.

	* Makefile.in: Move g_cnffile.c to REALMDBSRCS to allow 
	Windows to override this functionality with a routine in 
	win_store.c routine.

	allow the password not to be passed in, since there is code that
	does interesting things in the passwd_to_key routine.

	* g_svc_in_tkt.c (stub_key): don't assume C_Block is a struct; use
	memcpy instead of *.

	* log.c (krb_log): use char* instead of int for default args.

	makefile and object files rolled into one -- all binary)
	for the Kerberos library built for linking into applications
	(for debugging).
	* %KrbLib-project-A4:  Ditto, for linking into device drivers.

	* mac_stubs.c:  New file, implements the function-call
	interface of "kerberos.h" by making calls to a device-driver
	using the hairy Mac interface of "krb_driver.h".  If you
	link with this, your Mac program can use a portable, clean
	interface to Kerberos.

	* g_tkt_svc.c:  New file, krb_get_ticket_for_service,
	an "easy application kerberizer", derived from kclient.

	* err_txt.c (krb_err_txt):  Avoid pointers to string initializers,
	since Think C can't cope with this in device drivers.
	(krb_get_err_table):  Remove interface, unused.

Thu Jun 30 22:58:59 1994  John Gilmore  (gnu@tweedledumb.cygnus.com)

	* *.c:  Remove remaining RCS ID strings.  Strings used as `char *'
	initializers upset Think C when building device drivers, since it
	doesn't have a good way to relocate the pointers when the driver
	is loaded.

	* *.c:  Use #include "..." rather than #include <...> for
	our own local include files, because Think C can't find them
	when enclosed in <...>.

Fri Jun 17 02:02:00 1994  John Gilmore  (gnu@cygnus.com)

	* DNR.c:  New file of MacTCP interface code.
	* macsock.c:  To avoid using StreamPtr in <macsock.h>, declare

	Service resolution.
	* mac_store.c:  Eliminate credential storage, leaving just
	configuration storage.  Initialize the store whenever a
	high-level routine is called and we haven't initialized.
	Return result from init_store, so callers can return
	KFAILURE if we can't read the config data.
	* mac_store.h:  Pull credential storage (now in memcache.h).
	* unix_glue.c (krb_start_session, krb_end_session,
	krb_get_default_user):  Provide dummy ones on Unix.

Thu Jun  9 00:47:59 1994  John Gilmore  (gnu@cygnus.com)

	(krb_get_tf_fullname): If ticket cache selector is null, use
	default cache.  (Cache selector used to be the result of
	tkt_string; now tkt_string is called when it is null.)

	* send_to_kdc.c:  Replace all debug printf's with calls to
	the DEB macro, which is a no-op unless #define DEBUG.
	Insert #ifdef DEBUG where that is inconvenient.  (DLL libc

	easier.
	
	* g_pw_in_tkt.c (krb_get_pw_in_tkt):  Declare as INTERFACE.
	Give an explicit error if the supplied password is null;
	this forces the caller to supply us one, rather than relying
	on a Kerberos library routine to interact with the user.  Lint.
	(passwd_to_key):  Make extern.  Don't call *_read_password.
	(krb_get_pw_in_tkt_preauth):  Give error for null password.

	except that we made all the routine names uppercase, to match what
	MicroSoft C does when you declare an interface routine PASCAL
	(like all these routines).

	functions for DLL access to the error table.

	* g_admhst.c, g_cred.c, g_krbhst.c, g_phost.c, g_svc_in_tkt.c,
	kname_parse.c, mk_err.c, mk_priv.c, mk_req.c, mk_safe.c, rd_err.c,
	rd_priv.c, rd_req.c, rd_safe.c, realmofhost.c, recvauth.c,
	sendauth.c: Add INTERFACE declaration to definitions of functions
	that are exported via the DLL interface.

	* win_glue.c (win_time_gmt_unixsec):  Use static storage for
	_ftime() arg, since it takes a near pointer and can't point to
	stack storage when SS!=DS.
	(in_tkt, save_credentials, krb_save_credentials, krb_get_cred,
	dest_tkt, krb_get_tf_realm, krb_set_tkt_string,
	krb_ignore_ip_address):  Dummy routines for now.
	(LibMain, WEP):  No-op routines required for DLL initialization.
	(krb_start_session, krb_end_session): No-op routines required for
	Kerberos Mac interface compatability.

	* save_creds.c (krb_save_credentials):  Add new interface function
	to replace save_credentials, which isn't well enough named to
	export as part of the Kerberos interface.

	* kname_parse.c, kparse.c, rd_safe.c, send_to_kdc.c:  Move
	printf's under #ifdef DEBUG since printf is not usually available
	in MS-Windows.  Change exit()'s under "can't happen" conditions to
	return statements.

	* g_krbhst.c:  Clean up #ifdef'd braces so they match up.
	* sendauth.c:  Remove unused "extern int errno;".

	* mk_err.c, save_creds.c:  Remove RCS crud.
	* ren.msg:  Add rd_preauth.c and mk_preauth.c to DOS rename table.

Wed May 25 09:17:06 1994  D V Henkel-Wallace  (gumby@tweedledumb.cygnus.com)

	* g_pw_in_tkt.c: when read_password.c was inserted whole into this
	file, des.h and conf.h were #include'ed, which causes circularity
	problems.  #include's removed; they weren't needed anyway.

Tue May 24 00:55:30 1994  John Gilmore  (gnu@cygnus.com)

	* sendauth.c:  Break up into separately callable functions to
	avoid pushing binary data down a socket supposedly controlled
	by the kerberos library's caller.
	(krb_mk_auth):  New; builds a packet and returns it to you.
	(krb_net_rd_sendauth):  Reads a packet from the net.
	(krb_check_auth):  Checks an incoming response for validity.
	FIXME:  ATHENA_COMPAT code in here is now broken.  Remove it?
	FIXME:  Break up into separate files so that the non file
	descriptor part can be included on Mac.

	* g_admhst.c, mk_req.c:  Pull RCS crud.

	* mk_req.c:  Allow the realm argument to be defaulted with a null
	pointer.  This makes it suitable for building krb_sendauth
	messages directly.

	* tf_util.c (tf_init): If argument is null, call tkt_string to
	select a ticket cache.  See also ../../include/krb-sed.h, where
	the default argument was changed to be null.

	* send_to_kdc.c (MAX_HSTNM):  Eliminate only use of this obsolete
	define; use MAXHOSTNAMELEN which is set properly in each system.

	* fakeenv.c:  Update copyright notice (it's now public domain,
	freed by Cygnus Support, for whom the work was done for hire).

Mon May 23 00:19:46 1994  Mark Eichin  (eichin at tweedledumb.cygnus.com)

	* rd_svc_key.c (get_service_key): new function. Same as original
	read_service_key except that it takes argument kvno by reference,
	so the caller can figure out what key actually matched. Also
	defaults to KEYFILE if file argument is NULL (instead of just
	calling open with that value.) Also defaults to current realm if
	realm argument not passed in.
	(read_service_key): now calls get_service_key.

	* rd_safe.c (krb_rd_safe): check krb_ignore_ip_address before
	deciding to fail on an IP address check.
	(krb_rd_safe): remove "direction checking" code which doesn't
	actually help, and can interfere if IP addresses are optional.

	* rd_req.c (krb_rd_req): check krb_ignore_ip_address before
	deciding to fail on an IP address check; move test to end of
	function as well (to provide more information value in the
	RD_AP_BADD error return.)

	* rd_req.c: define (allocate) krb_ignore_ip_address.

	* rd_priv.c (krb_rd_priv): check global variable
	krb_ignore_ip_address before deciding to fail on an IP address
	check.
	(krb_rd_priv): remove "direction checking" code which doesn't
	actually help, and can interfere if IP addresses are optional.

	* netread.c (krb_net_read): use socket_read under VMS, assuming
	MultiNet. 

	* netwrite.c (krb_net_write): use socket_write under VMS, assuming
	MultiNet. 

	* mk_priv.c (krb_mk_priv): If private_msg_ver isn't set yet, use
	the expected version (KRB_PROT_VERSION) instead.

	* Makefile.in (SRCS, OBJS): added mk_preauth, rd_preauth.

	* g_in_tkt.c (krb_get_in_tkt_preauth): New function. Supports
	simple preauthentication by appending data to the initial packet.
	Demonstration hooks only.

	* g_svc_in_tkt.c (krb_get_svc_in_tkt_preauth): New function.
	Preauthentication support for initial tickets for servers.
	(krb_svc_init): New function. An interface to krb_get_svc_in_tkt
	that is provided by DEC's dss-kerberos, added here for
	compatibility.
	(krb_svc_init_preauth): preauthentication version of krb_svc_init.

	* g_pw_in_tkt.c	(krb_get_pw_in_tkt_preauth): New function.
	Higher level interface to g_in_tkt for users.

	* g_pw_in_tkt.c: in NOENCRYPTION section, pull in <sgtty.h>
	under __svr4__ so the ioctls work under Solaris.

Sat May 21 04:02:59 1994  John Gilmore  (gnu@cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in (c-libkrb.${LIBEXT}):  Typos, do .o->.obj.
	* gethostname.c:  Simplify to call GETHOSTNAME macro.
	* stime.c:  Arg is *time, not time.  Oops.  Also simplify.
	* win_glue.c:  Support CONVERT_TIME_EPOCH and make it work
	for the odd epoch on MSC 7.0.
	(win_socket_initialize):  New routine implements SOCKET_INITIALIZE.
	(in_tkt, save_credentials, dest_tkt):  Stubs to link kinit with.

	First FAR crap in our clean sources (sigh).

	* win_glue.c (far_fputs):  Print a far string returned by WinSock.
	* ad_print.c:  Handle FAR pointer from inet_ntoa.
	* g_phost.c:  Handle FAR pointer returned by gethostby*.
	
	* send_to_kdc.c: Convert to WinSock plus local macros that make
	compatability easier.  Initialize and terminate WinSock access
	each time we are called.  Handle FAR pointer from get*by* and
	inet_ntoa.  Bind the datagram socket before using it, to get
	beyond a bug in FTP Software's WinSock libraries.  Improve debug
	messages.

Thu May 19 22:57:13 1994  John Gilmore  (gnu@cygnus.com)

	More Windows support.

	* Makefile.in (LIBEXT):  Use everywhere.
	(SERVER_KRB_{SRCS,OBJS}):  Rename from SERVERSIDE*.
	(ARCHIVEARGS):  Implement MSC LIB support.
	(####):  Move insertion point of host-configuration fragments
	down so they can override the various Makefile macros.
	(libkrb.$(LIBEXT)):  Avoid keeping a .bak file.  Use ARCHIVEARGS.
	(unixdos):  New target for things that have to run on Unix
	after configuring for DOS.  (FIXME, make these work on DOS.)
	(c-libkrb.$(LIBEXT)):  Build control file for MSC.  This
	currently must run on Unix (FIXME).

	* stime.c:  Use CONVERT_TIME_EPOCH.

Sat May 14 00:49:11 1994  John Gilmore  (gnu@cygnus.com)

	More Macintosh merging.

	* Makefile.in (CACHESRCS, CACHEOBJS, REALMDBSRCS, REALMDBOBJS,
	SERVERSIDESRCS, SERVERSIDEOBJS):  Update the lists of files that
	belong to each category.
	* unix-glue.c, mac-glue.c, win-glue.c:  Rename to unix_glue.c,
	mac_glue.c, win_glue.c.
	* g_ad_tkt.c:  Improve comments on cross-realm support.
	* g_phost.c:  Remove RCS crud.
	* store.c, store.h:  Rename to mac_store.c, mac_store.h.  Insert
	all the Kerberos glue routines needed to talk to the Cygnus code.

Fri May 13 17:40:02 1994  John Gilmore  (gnu@cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in (SERVERSIDESRCS, SERVERSIDEOBJS):  Create
	as lists of lib/krb files only used on servers, so they can
	be avoided when on client-only machines.
	(CACHESRCS, CACHEOBJS):  Put all the rightful files in there.
	* realmofhost.c:  Pull <sys/param.h> and default MAXHOSTNAMELEN.

	* rd_safe.c, tf_shm.c:  Remove errno declaration, <errno.h>, etc.
	* mk_priv.c:  Comment changes.
	* g_ad_tkt.c:  Remove obsolete defn of <sys/time.h>.

Fri May 13 12:17:32 1994  John Gilmore  (gnu@cygnus.com)

	Macintosh changes.

	* store.h, store.c:  Ticket storage in memory on the Mac.
	* mac-glue.c:  New file, deals with OS and time interface.
	* Makefile.in:  Pull tf_util.[co] out into CACHESRCS and
	CACHEOBJS, so it can be excluded on Mac and Windows.
	* g_in_tkt.c:  Don't declare signed difference t_diff as unsigned!
	* g_ad_tkt.c, rd_safe.c, rd_req.c, rd_priv.c, mk_safe.c, mk_req.c:
	Remove <sys/time.h>.  Use TIME_GMT_UNIXSEC and clean up datatype
	issues around clock-skew/ticket-replay checking.  Remove __i960__
	conditionals, which should be handled by changing CLOCK_SKEW in
	960-specific config files.
	* mk_priv.c:  Rename TIME_GMT_UNIXSEC_MS to TIME_GMT_UNIXSEC_US.
	* setenv.c:  Remove <sys/types.h>.

Fri May 13 02:02:56 1994  John Gilmore  (gnu@cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in:  Support glue files for each major architecture
	(Unix, mac, windows).  Replace {} with () for DOS NMAKE.
	Build krb_err.h without `make depend'.  Remove -DBSD42 since it
	is no longer used.

	* send_to_kdc.c:  Pull <netdb.h>.
	* setenv.c:  Add "conf.h" for non-cmd-line configuration.

Sun May  8 23:34:16 1994  John Gilmore  (gnu@cygnus.com)

	Include-file straightening:  Remove Unix include
	files from as many routines as possible -- particularly
	<sys/types.h> and network include files.

	* ad_print.c:  Use DEFINE_SOCKADDR to get struct sockaddr_in.
	Lint.  Pull RCS crud.
	* cr_err_repl.c, tf_shm.c, tf_util.c, tkt_string.c:  Pull
	<sys/types.h>.
	* cr_tkt.c, decomp_tkt.c:  Pull <stdio.h>.
	* dest_tkt.c, in_tkt.c, mk_err.c:  Pull <sys/types.h>
	* g_ad_tkt.c:  Pull <sys/types.h>, <errno.h>, RCS crud.
	* g_cred.c:  Pull RCS crud, add <string.h>.
	* g_in_tkt.c:  Pull <sys/types.h>, <errno.h>, <stdio.h>, RCS crud.
	* g_tf_fname.c:  Lint, pull RCS crud.
	* kuserok.c:  <pull <sys/types.h> and <sys/socket.h>.
	* rd_err.c:  Pull <stdio.h>, <errno.h>, <sys/types.h>, <sys/times.h>.
	* mk_priv.c, mk_safe.c, rd_err.c, rd_priv.c, rd_safe.c,
	recvauth.c, send_to_kdc.c, sendauth.c:  Use DEFINE_SOCKADDR to get
	struct sockaddr_in.

	* strcasecmp.c:  Remove <sys/types.h> and change the few
	occurrances of u_foo types to `unsigned foo'.  Pull SCCS crud(!).

Sun May  8 19:24:08 1994  John Gilmore  (gnu@cygnus.com)

	* add_tkt.c, ext_tkt.c:  Remove, unused.  As its comments say:
	This routine is now obsolete.  It used to be possible to request
	more than one ticket at a time from the authentication server, and
	it looks like this routine was used by the server to package the
	tickets to be returned to the client.

	* g_request.c:  Remove, unused.  Its comments:
	This procedure is obsolete.  It is used in the kerberos_slave
	code for Version 3 tickets.

	* getopt.c:  Remove, unused.
	* Makefile.in:  Remove unused files.

Sat May  7 13:44:20 1994  John Gilmore  (gnu@cygnus.com)

	* krbglue.c:  Remove, unused.  Mark Eichin says:
	krbglue, if I recall correctly, was backwards compatibility code so
	that programs that were written with V3 could be relinked with V4
	without recompiling. The Zephyr code used it at one point, though I
	doubt it does anymore. It's probably sufficient to note that in the
	cvs log when you delete it.

	* krbglue.c, recvauth.c, sendauth.c:  Lint.

Fri May  6 21:11:10 1994  John Gilmore  (gnu@cygnus.com)

	* ren-cyg.sh, ren-pc.sh, ren-pl10.sh, ren.msg.sh, ren2dos,
	ren2long.sh sed-cyg.sh, ren-pc.bat, sed-pc.sh:  Update for final
	DOS renaming.

Fri May  6 18:32:11 1994  John Gilmore  (gnu@cygnus.com)

	* rd_priv.c, mk_priv.c, rd_safe.c, mk_safe.c:  Rename include
	file "lsb_addr_comp.h" to "lsb_addr_cmp.h" for DOS/SYSV.

Fri May  6 02:10:50 1994  John Gilmore  (gnu@cygnus.com)

	* krbglue.c: Move Kerberos function prototypes to ../include/krb.h.
	Yank RCS.  Lint.
	* mk_priv.c (krb_mk_priv), rd_priv.c (krb_rd_priv):  Lint.  Yank RCS.

Thu May  5 12:49:34 1994  John Gilmore  (gnu@cygnus.com)

	* decomp_tkt.c: Remove need for <sys/file.h> under KRB_CRYPT_DEBUG
	by using stdio.  Call krb_log, not log.  Lint.  Remove RCS ID's.

	* g_tf_realm.c:  Lint.

Tue Apr 26 20:54:29 1994  John Gilmore  (gnu@tweedledumb.cygnus.com)

	Massive file renaming for DOS compatability.

	* ren.msg, ren-cyg.sh, sed-cyg.sh:  New files.

	* Imakefile, Makefile.in:  File names edited throughout.

	* add_ticket.c, cr_auth_reply.c, cr_err_reply.c, create_ciph.c,
	create_ticket.c, debug_decl.c, decomp_ticket.c, extract_tkt.c,
	get_ad_tkt.c, get_admhst.c, get_cred.c, get_in_tkt.c, get_krbhst.c,
	get_krbrlm.c, get_phost.c, get_pw_tkt.c, get_request.c, get_svc_in.c,
	get_tf_fname.c, get_tf_realm.c, getrealm.c, k_gethostname.c,
	krb_err_txt.c, krb_get_in.c, read_svc_key.c, util.c:  Renamed.

	* ad_print.c, add_tkt.c, cr_auth_repl.c, cr_ciph.c, cr_err_repl.c,
	cr_tkt.c, debug.c, decomp_tkt.c, err_txt.c, ext_tkt.c, g_ad_tkt.c,
	g_admhst.c, g_cred.c, g_in_tkt.c, g_krbhst.c, g_krbrlm.c,
	g_phost.c, g_pw_in_tkt.c, g_pw_tkt.c, g_request.c, g_svc_in_tkt.c,
	g_tf_fname.c, g_tf_realm.c, gethostname.c, rd_svc_key.c,
	realmofhost.c:  Same files, renamed.

Sun Jan 30 17:28:57 1994  Ken Raeburn  (raeburn@cujo.cygnus.com)

	* getrealm.c (krb_realmofhost): Rearrange loop so that strcasecmp
	is called only once for domains listed in krb.conf, and exiting
	function is cleaner.
