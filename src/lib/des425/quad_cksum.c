/*
 * Algorithm (per paper):
 *		define:
 *		message to be composed of n m-bit blocks X1,...,Xn
 *		optional secret seed S in block X1
 *		MDC in block Xn+1
 *		prime modulus N
 *		accumulator Z
 *		initial (secret) value of accumulator C
 *		N, C, and S are known at both ends
 *		C and , optionally, S, are hidden from the end users
 *		then
 *			(read array references as subscripts over time)
 *			Z[0] = c;
 *			for i = 1...n
 *				Z[i] = (Z[i+1] + X[i])**2 modulo N
 *			X[n+1] = Z[n] = MDC
 *
 *		Then pick
 *			N = 2**31 -1
 *			m = 16
 *			iterate 4 times over plaintext, also use Zn
 *			from iteration j as seed for iteration j+1,
 *			total MDC is then a 128 bit array of the four
 *			Zn;
 *
 *			return the last Zn and optionally, all
 *			four as output args.
 *
 * Modifications:
 *	To inhibit brute force searches of the seed space, this
 *	implementation is modified to have
 *	Z	= 64 bit accumulator
 *	C	= 64 bit C seed
 *	N	= 2**63 - 1
 *  S	= S seed is not implemented here
 *	arithmetic is not quite real double integer precision, since we
 *	cant get at the carry or high order results from multiply,
 *	but nontheless is 64 bit arithmetic.
