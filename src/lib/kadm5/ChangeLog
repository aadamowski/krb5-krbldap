	* Makefile.in (CLNTOBJS), AC_REPLACE_FUNCS: check for setenv, and
 	link against setenv.o if it's needed.

Fri Jul 12 15:06:48 1996  Marc Horowitz  <marc@mit.edu>

	* svr_iters.c (glob_to_regexp:append_realm): the semantics and
 	code were somewhat confused.  they are now fixed.

	* logger.c (HAVE_*): turn all the "#if HAVE_*" into
	"#ifdef HAVE_*"

	* configure.in (AC_CHECK_FUNCS): check for the functions which
 	logger.c checks for.

	* svr_principal.c (kadm5_get_principal): due to the the api
 	versioning, it is possible for this function to be called with a
 	three argument prototype.  in this case, do not modify mask,
 	because this will clobber the stack on some platforms.

	* client_principal.c (kadm5_create_principal): be more careful
 	about what sorts of things are referenced, passed down, and passed
 	back if the caller is api v1.

Wed Jul 10 01:29:34 1996  Marc Horowitz  <marc@mit.edu>

	* configure.in: added autoconf support

Tue Jul  9 17:38:43 1996  Marc Horowitz  <marc@mit.edu>

	* svr_iters.c (*_REGEXPS): rework the conditionals to operate
 	as functions of function symbols tested by configure.
	* client_init.c (setenv, unsetenv declarations): make them the
 	same as the stdlib declarations, if they're going to be here at
 	all.
	* Makefile.in: reworked to support building both libraries.  this
 	required a bunch of changes, including some coordinating ones in
 	aclocal.m4

	* svr_principal.c (kadm5_decrypt_key): add kadm5_decrypt_key

Mon Jul  8 16:55:22 1996  Barry Jaspan  <bjaspan@mit.edu>

	* svr_iters.c (kadm5_get_either): append local ream to globs with
 	no realm

	* alt_prof.c: fix dbname, admin_dbname, and admin_lockfile to
 	derive from each other as in spec

	* adb_policy.c: add create_db/destroy_db

	* adb_openclose.c: add create_db/destroy_db, fix handling of
 	permanent locks, handle multiple lock files via static linked list

	* adb.h: update create_db/destroy_db to make params instead of
 	explicit values

	* Makefile.ov (TOP): Use ../../kadmin, not kadmin.ov
