	* svr_iters.c (*_REGEXPS): rework the conditionals to operate
 	as functions of function symbols tested by configure.
	* client_init.c (setenv, unsetenv declarations): make them the
 	same as the stdlib declarations, if they're going to be here at
 	all.
	* Makefile.in: reworked to support building both libraries.  this
 	required a bunch of changes, including some coordinating ones in
 	aclocal.m4
