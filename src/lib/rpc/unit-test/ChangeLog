2000-06-08  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* lib/helpers.exp (kinit): Move "expect eof" into the commands
	that send the prompt.  Don't "expect eof" outside of the main
	expect, as the main expect may have already read eof.

2000-02-15  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* server.c: Add code to set a signal handler for SIGHUP and a few
	others so that purify will actually generate memory leak reports.

	* configure.in: Add CHECK_SIGNALS.

2000-02-07  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* config/unix.exp: Call send_error instead of fail to prevent
	referencing variables not yet set up by the test framework.

	* lib/helpers.exp: Call kinit and kdestroy with the -5 flag to
	deal with new program behavior.  Also call perror rather than
	error to avoid spewing a stack trace.

1999-10-26  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Clean up usage of CFLAGS, CPPFLAGS, DEFS, DEFINES,
	LOCAL_INCLUDES such that one can override CFLAGS from the command
	line without losing CPP search patchs and defines. Some associated
	Makefile cleanup. [from wsanchez@apple.com]

1999-09-21  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in (unit-test-body-tcp, unit-test-body-udp): Pass
	$(RUNTESTFLAGS) to runtest.

1998-11-13  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@rsts-11.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Set the myfulldir and mydir variables (which are
		relative to buildtop and thisconfigdir, respectively.)

	* configure.in: Use K5_AC_OUTPUT instead of K5_OUTPUT_FILES.

	* server.c: Update header locations.

Thu Feb 12 16:39:38 1998  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* client.c (main): Tweak the kludge variable
	krb5_gss_dbg_clietn_expcreds so we can send expired creds to the
	server.

Mon Feb  2 16:59:48 1998  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@rsts-11.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Define BUILDTOP and thisconfigdir in the Makefile

Thu Oct  9 20:58:35 1997  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* configure.in, Makefile.in: Add test to disable udp test under
 	Solaris 2.0 thru 2.5; a getsockname() bug prevents channel
	bindings from working.

Thu Feb  6 15:58:52 1997  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in:
	* configure.in: Update to new program build procedure.

Wed Nov 20 16:00:21 1996  Barry Jaspan  <bjaspan@mit.edu>

Thu Nov 14 22:27:05 1996  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* server.c (main): Add declaration of optind for systems that
	don't have it in stdio.h or the like.

Thu Nov 14 15:27:05 1996  Barry Jaspan  <bjaspan@mit.edu>

 	[krb5-libs/180]

Tue Nov 12 14:58:20 1996  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* rpc_test_setup.sh: Fix test of $VERBOSE_TEST so that $VERBOSE
	only gets set if $VERBOSE_TEST is not empty.

Mon Nov 11 20:52:27 1996  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* rpc_test_setup.sh: Use a temp file rather than a here document
	feeding into eval because Ultrix sh doesn't deal.

Mon Nov 11 14:22:30 1996  Tom Yu  <chaoself@avalanche-breakdown.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in (client.o, server.o): client.o and server.o, not
	client.c and server.c, depend on rpc_test.h.

Thu Nov  7 16:16:38 1996  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* configure.in: Remove spurious KRB_INCLUDE and WITH_CCOPTS.

	* Makefile.in (server.o): Fix typo in previous checkin.

Wed Nov  6 16:12:26 1996  Tom Yu <tlyu@mit.edu>
	* Makefile.in: Add dependencies on $(srcdir)/foo.c so that some
	makes can deal with VPATH properly (e.g. NetBSD pmake)

Mon Nov  4 23:12:06 1996  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@rsts-11.mit.edu>

	* server.c: We don't need the special case for linux anymore,
 		since we're including the output from rpcgen in the source
 		tree now.

Thu Oct 31 13:14:45 1996  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in (client,server): Use $(LD) instead of $(CC) in link
		stage. 

Thu Oct 31 08:47:47 1996  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Only run tests if required programs, libraries
		available.  

	* configure.in: Check for runtest, Perl, and tcl before making checks.

 	rpc_text.x [krb5-admin/133]

Wed Oct 16 16:13:13 1996  Barry Jaspan  <bjaspan@mit.edu>

	* rpc_test.0/expire.exp: add test for expired credentials
	[krb5-admin/17]
	
	* server.c (log_miscerr): add log_miscerr

	* Makefile.in: don't delete rpc_test.x, we might be in souce tree

	* initial changes to make rpc unit tests work with new build/test
 	system
