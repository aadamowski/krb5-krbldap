	* rpc_dtablesize.c (_rpc_dtablesize): put in a few checks to make
 	sure that the return value is never larger than FD_SETSIZE, since
 	this function's purpose is to be used as the first arg to
 	select().

	* rpc.h, netdb.h, getrpcent.c: Our build can (and will) require
 	that the rpc header files shipped with kerberos be used if the
 	library shipped with kerberos is used.  Thus, some simplifying
 	assumptions can be made, mostly having to do with the declaration
 	of struct rpcent and the related functions.
	* clnt_perror.c: made usage of sys_errlist conditional on
 	NEED_SYS_ERRLIST
	* configure.in (DECLARE_SYS_ERRLIST): added
 	* Makefile.in (DONE): added a few rules and variable so shared
 	library creation would work
