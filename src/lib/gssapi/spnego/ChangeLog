	* spnego_mech.c (check_spnego_options, create_spnego_ctx): Force
	to 1 for testing purposes.
	(spnego_gss_init_sec_context): Don't check for mechListMIC if
	MS_Interop is true.
	(make_spnego_tokenTarg_msg): Never send duplicate AP-REP as
	mechListMIC; omit mechListMIC instead.

	* spnego_mech.c: s/uchar_t/unsigned char/g.  Bash cast to
	uint32_t, but that should get looked at again in detail.

	* gssapiP_spnego.h: Don't include synch.h.

	* spnego_mech.c (spnego_mechanism): Tweak for correct ordering of
	pointers.
	(gss_mech_initialize): Disable for now.

	* gssapiP_spnego.h, spnego_mech.c: Rename symbols for namespace
