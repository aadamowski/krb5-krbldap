1999-10-26  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Clean up usage of CFLAGS, CPPFLAGS, DEFS, DEFINES,
	LOCAL_INCLUDES such that one can override CFLAGS from the command
	line without losing CPP search patchs and defines. Some associated
	Makefile cleanup. [from wsanchez@apple.com]

1999-06-28  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* dk_encrypt.c (krb5_marc_dk_encrypt): Call
	krb5_marc_dk_encrypt_length() instead of krb5_dk_encrypt_length()
	to prevent blocksize errors.

Mon May 10 15:16:34 1999  Danilo Almeida  <dalmeida@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Do win32 build in subdir.

Tue Jan  5 00:09:13 1999  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* dk.h: Add prototypes for krb5_marc_dk_*.

	* dk_encrypt.c (krb5_marc_dk_encrypt): Add compat for 32-bit
	length coded ciphertext.

	* dk_decrypt.c (krb5_marc_dk_decrypt): Add compat for 32-bit
	length coded ciphertext.

	* checksum.c: Add compat for 32-bit length included checksum.
	Note that nothing uses this at the moment, and probably
	shouldn't.

1998-11-13  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@rsts-11.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Set the myfulldir and mydir variables (which are
		relative to buildtop and thisconfigdir, respectively.)
