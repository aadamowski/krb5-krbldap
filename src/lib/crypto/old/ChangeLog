	* old_encrypt.c (krb5_old_encrypt): Chain ivecs.

	* old_decrypt.c (krb5_old_decrypt): Chain ivecs.

2000-01-21  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

	* des_stringtokey.c (mit_des_string_to_key_int): Declare.
	* old_decrypt.c (krb5_old_decrypt): Delete unused variable.
	Change if(a=b) constructs to silence gcc warning.
	* old_encrypt.c (krb5_old_encrypt): Change if(a=b) constructs to
	silence gcc warning.

1999-10-26  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Clean up usage of CFLAGS, CPPFLAGS, DEFS, DEFINES,
	LOCAL_INCLUDES such that one can override CFLAGS from the command
	line without losing CPP search patchs and defines. Some associated
	Makefile cleanup. [from wsanchez@apple.com]

1999-08-25  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

	* old_decrypt.c (memmove) [HAVE_BCOPY && !HAVE_MEMMOVE]: Define to
	use bcopy.  Should work unless any system has no memmove *and*
	bcopy isn't safe with overlaps.

Mon May 10 15:20:32 1999  Danilo Almeida  <dalmeida@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Do win32 build in subdir.

Wed Dec 16 16:14:02 1998  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* old_decrypt.c (krb5_old_decrypt): Initialize the ivec to the key
 	if we're using DES_CBC_CRC, for backwards compatibility.  We
 	weren't noticing this before because it only trashes the first
 	block, which is the confounder, which we weren't actually
 	verifying because checksum was unconditionally succeeding prior to
 	the other patch.

Thu Dec 10 22:16:14 1998  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* old_decrypt.c (krb5_old_decrypt): Actually compare the
	calculated checksum against the provided checksum.

1998-11-13  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@rsts-11.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Set the myfulldir and mydir variables (which are
		relative to buildtop and thisconfigdir, respectively.)
