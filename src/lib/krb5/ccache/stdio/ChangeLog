		relative to buildtop and thisconfigdir, respectively.)

Fri Feb 27 18:03:33 1998  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@rsts-11.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Changed thisconfigdir to point at the lib/krb5
 		directory, since we've moved all of the configure.in
		tests to the toplevel lib/krb5 configure.in

Wed Feb 18 16:20:44 1998  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

Wed Oct 29 15:57:31 1997  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@mit.edu>

	* scc_maybe.c: Added kludge for the Macintosh, since fopen()

Thu Sep 25 21:04:47 1997  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* scc_maybe.c (krb5_scc_open_file): Replace HAS_SETVBUF with

	* scc-proto.h, scc_reslv.c (krb5_scc_resolve): Incoming name

Wed Feb 14 10:44:27 1996    <tytso@rsts-11.mit.edu>

	* scc_read.c (krb5_scc_read_keyblock, krb5_scc_read_data,
		krb5_scc_read_authdatum, krb5_scc_read_addr): For windows,

		wrong.

Wed Mar 20 22:50:05 1996  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* scc-proto.h (krb5_scc_skip_header): Added prototype (to fix lint

	* scc_retrv.c (krb5_scc_retrieve): Accept any enctype unless doing a specific match.

Thu Jan 25 14:44:48 1996  Sam Hartman  <hartmans@tertius.mit.edu>

	* scc_gennew.c (krb5_scc_generate_new): Use
		context->scc_default_format to determine the credentials
		cache type.

	* scc_read.c (krb5_scc_read_keyblock): If reading in a version 3
		credentials cache, ignore the second enctype stored in the
		ccache; just read it into a dummy variable.

Thu Dec 21 18:33:39 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* scc_maybe.c (krb5_scc_open_file): In the case of
		SCC_OPEN_AND_ERASE, unlink the filename first, in case
		there's a symbolic link lurking about.  (We should do an
		exclusive open then, but there's no such thing in stdio.)
		(krb5_scc_open_file): Use KRB5_CC_FORMAT as an error code
		instead of KRB5_CCACHE_BADVNO, when it's really a format
		error in the credentials cache file.

	* Makefile.in: Removed "foo:: foo-$(WHAT)" lines from the

Thu Sept 7 12:00:00 EDT 1995	James Mattly	(mattly@fusion.com)

	* scc_retrv.c: fixed paramter passing in a call to standard_fields_match.
		prototypes would have caught this.

Tue Sep 05 22:58:52 1995

        * scc.h : Add another KRB5_SCC_FVNO but don't up the default.
        * scc_gennew.c, scc_maybe.c : New version saves a length after
                version for whatever we want to put into the ccache before
                the first credential (like a time skew)
        * scc_read.c, scc_write.c : Remove krb5_enctype references, and
                replace with krb5_keytype where appropriate

Tue Aug 29 13:36:39 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* scc_reslv.c - Set magic number in successfully resolved ccache.

	* scc_init.c (krb5_scc_initialize): Make sure the status return
	        from krb5_scc_store_principal is reflected in the return
		status of krb5_scc_initialize().

Fri Jun  9 19:30:35 1995    <tytso@rsx-11.mit.edu>

	* configure.in: Remove standardized set of autoconf macros, which
		are now handled by CONFIG_RULES.

	* scc_maybe.c: Fix -Wall nit

Fri May 26 20:19:49 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* configure.in, Makefile.in: Add support for building shared libraries.

Thu Apr 13 16:32:12 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* scc_genn.c: __STDC__ conditional also checks the _WINDOWS define.

Sat Mar 25 14:42:37 1995  Tom Yu  (tlyu@dragons-lair)

	* scc_maybe.c (krb5_scc_open_file): fixed typo (extra & in
	reference to fvno_bytes)

	* scc_gennew.c: Ultrix cc (and K&R compilers) doesn't deal with
	automatic aggregate initialization, so fixed scc_fvno usage.

Fri Mar 17 19:24:05 1995  John Gilmore  (gnu at toad.com)

	* scc_errs.c:  Mac doesn't have EISDIR error.
	* scc_gennew.c, scc_maybe.c:  Eliminate the use of htons and ntohs
	for byte order handling; just do it by hand.
	* scc_read.c (krb5_scc_read_authdatum):  Zap unused variable "ret".
	* Makefile.in (LDFLAGS):  Eliminate, duplicates config/pre.in.

Tue Mar  7 19:55:01 1995  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* configure.in: take out ISODE_DEFS.

Tue Feb 28 00:36:36 1995  John Gilmore  (gnu at toad.com)

	* scc.h, scc_gennew.c, scc_maybe.c:  Avoid <krb5/...> includes.

Fri Jan 27 00:49:36 1995  Chris Provenzano (proven@mit.edu)

	* Fix scc_read.c (krb5_scc_read_authdatum()) krb5_authdatatype
		is of type unsigned int and therefore shouldn't be the
		argument to krb5_scc_read_ui_2().

Fri Jan 13 15:23:47 1995  Chris Provenzano (proven@mit.edu)

    * Added krb5_context to all krb5_routines 

Tue Dec 13 15:42:50 1994    <tytso@rsx-11.mit.edu>

	(krb5_scc_next_cred), scc_store.c (krb5_scc_store), scc_read.c,
	scc_write.c:  Changes to implement SCC format version #3, which
		is architecture independent, and includes the key
		encryption type information.

Wed Nov 16 23:40:16 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* scc_gennew.c (krb5_scc_generate_new): Generate new ccaches using
		whatever version is marked as the default.

	* scc_read.c (krb5_scc_read_keyblock): Insert keyblock magic
		number and initialize etype value.  Also add magic numbers
		for the krb5_principal, krb5_data, krb5_address, and
		krb5_authdata structures.

	  scc_ops.c (krb5_scc_ops): Add placeholder for magic number

Thu Sep 22 21:38:09 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* scc_destry.c (krb5_scc_destroy): Make sure memory associated
		with the credentials cache is freed after it is destroyed.

	* scc_maybe.c (krb5_scc_open_file): changed an #ifdef from
	ANSI_STDIO to HAS_SETVBUF
