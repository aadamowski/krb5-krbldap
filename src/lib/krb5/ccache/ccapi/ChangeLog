	* stdcc.c (krb5_stdcc_retrieve): Replace with a version that calls
	krb5_cc_retrieve_cred_default.

1999-08-05	Alexandra Ellwood <lxs@mit.edu>

	* stdcc_util.c (deep_free_cc_v5_creds):
		Added free(creds) so that the cc_creds gets freed when a 
		cred_union gets freed.  Before it was leaking memory.

		I searched the k5 sources for folks calling deep_free_cc_v5_creds 
		and my change seems to not break anyone else.

	* stdcc.c (krb5_stdcc_destroy):
		Added code to free the krb5_ccache like krb5_stdcc_close does 
		so we don't leak memory.
		
1999-06-10  Danilo Almeida  <dalmeida@mit.edu>

	* stdcc.c (cache_changed): Use PostMessage instead of SendMessage
		so that we don't block.

1999-06-08  Danilo Almeida  <dalmeida@mit.edu>

	* winccld.h:  Remove references to cc_*_instance functions.

Thu May 13 18:01:58 1999  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@mit.edu>

	* winccld.c (krb5_win_ccdll_load): Register the FILE ccache type
		if we are using ccapi, so that we make sure the FILE
		ccache type will work if the user specifies it in an
		environment variable.

Mon May 10 15:24:36 1999  Danilo Almeida  <dalmeida@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Do win32 build in subdir.

Thu Apr  8 16:09:08 1999  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@mit.edu>

	* winccld.c: Only compile this file on Windows (to avoid screwing
		up the Macintosh build).

1999-03-31  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@rsts-11.mit.edu>

	* winccld.c, winccld.h, stdcc.c: Add files to dynamically load
		krbcc32.dll, so that we can fall back and use the built-in
		file ccache type if krbcc32.dll doesn't exist.

1998-11-13  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@rsts-11.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Set the myfulldir and mydir variables (which are
		relative to buildtop and thisconfigdir, respectively.)
