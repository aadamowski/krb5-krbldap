2001-02-27	Alexandra Ellwood <lxs@mit.edu>

	* ccdefault.h: Updated Mac OS #defines and #includes for new header layout 
	and Mac OS X frameworks
	
2000-09-12	Alexandra Ellwood <lxs@mit.edu>

        * ccdefops.c: created #define for USE_CCAPI now that both Mac OS 9 and
        Mac OS 10 use ccapi.

2000-5-31	Alexandra Ellwood <lxs@mit.edu>

	* ccdefault.c: Changed kerberosPrincipal_V5 to kerberosVersion_V5 to reflect 
	the new constant name.

2000-5-19	Alexandra Ellwood <lxs@mit.edu>

	* ccdefault.c: Added krb5int_cc_default.  This function 
	supports the Kerberos Login Library and pops up a dialog if the cache does 
	not contain valid tickets.  This is used to automatically get a tgt before
	obtaining service tickets.  Note that this should be an internal function
	because callers don't expect krb5_cc_default to pop up a dialog!
	(We found this out the hard way :-)

2000-4-26	Alexandra Ellwood <lxs@mit.edu>

	* ccdefault.c: Added version number to internal Kerberos Login Library 
	routine.

2000-4-13	Alexandra Ellwood <lxs@mit.edu>

	* ccdefault.c: Added Kerberos Login library support (with ifdefs to control 
	whether or not it is on.  Also added support to store a krb5_principal in the
	os_context along with the default ccache name (if known, this principal is 
	the same as the last time we looked at the ccache.
	* ccdefname.c: Added support to store a krb5_principal in the os_context 
	along with the default ccache name (if known, this principal is the same 
	as the last time we looked at the ccache.

1999-10-26  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Clean up usage of CFLAGS, CPPFLAGS, DEFS, DEFINES,
	LOCAL_INCLUDES such that one can override CFLAGS from the command
	line without losing CPP search patchs and defines. Some associated
	Makefile cleanup. [from wsanchez@apple.com]

1999-08-23  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@mit.edu>

	* cc_retr.c: New file.
	(krb5_cc_retrieve_cred_seq): New function, derived from
	fcc_retrieve but takes an optional list of enctypes to look for in
	priority order.
	(krb5_cc_retrieve_cred_default): New function.  Same signature as
	original fcc_retrieve but if new flag KRB5_TC_SUPPORTED_KTYPES is
	set, calls krb5_get_tgs_ktypes to get a list of enctypes to look
	for.
	* Makefile.in (STLIBOBJS, OBJS, SRCS): Add it.

Tue May 18 19:52:56 1999  Danilo Almeida  <dalmeida@mit.edu>

1999-03-31  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@rsts-11.mit.edu>

	* ccdefops.c: Change the default ccache type under windows to be
		original FILE ccache type; this will get set to ccapi if
		the krbcc32.dll can be found.

Mon Feb  8 21:53:37 1999  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Enable the ccapi directory for windows builds.

		machines.

1998-11-13  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@rsts-11.mit.edu>

		relative to buildtop and thisconfigdir, respectively.)

Sat Dec  5 01:20:31 1998  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in, ccdefops.c: Temporarily back out the ccapi ccache
		under Windows so we can make sure the rest of the krb5
		tree builds correctly under Windows.  (Note: I didn't
		revert lib/krb5/os/ccdefname.c, so setting KRB5_CC_NAME to
		FILE:C:\tmp\tkt is required to make things work.)

	* Makefile.in: Add windows build instructions to build CCache API
		Cache implementation.

	* Makefile.in: Add ccache/memory as a directory to be recursively
		built by this makefile under Windows.

Fri Feb 27 18:03:33 1998  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@rsts-11.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Changed thisconfigdir to point at the lib/krb5
 		directory, since we've moved the configure.in tests in
 		this directory to the toplevel lib/krb5 configure.in

Thu Jun  6 00:04:38 1996  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in (all-windows): Don't pass $(LIBCMD) on the command
		line.  It's set in the windows.in prologue for all
		Makefiles anyway.

Wed Feb  7 00:23:18 1996  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* Makefile.in: Folded in danw's changes to allow

		routines.

Fri Jun  9 19:31:13 1995    <tytso@rsx-11.mit.edu>

	* configure.in: Remove standardized set of autoconf macros, which
		are now handled by CONFIG_RULES.  Use DO_SUBDIRS to
		recurse down subdirectories.

Fri May 26 20:19:26 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* configure.in, Makefile.in: Add support for building shared libraries.

	(CFLAGS):  Add -I options for file and stdio, to avoid paths in
	#include statements.
	(all-mac, clean-mac):  Add.

	on the Mac.  Configure the default cache based on whether the
	system has <sys/types.h> (which defines types for low-level file
	operations, among other things).
	* configure.in (CONFIG_DIRS):  Build stdio before file, for Mac
	convenience (where file doesn't build).

Wed Mar 15 20:23:17 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)
