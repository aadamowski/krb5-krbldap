Fri Jan  3 16:47:59 1997  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in:
	* configure.in: Update to new library build procedure.

Mon Nov 18 20:42:39 1996  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@mit.edu>

	* configure.in: Set shared library version to 1.0. [krb5-libs/201]

Wed Oct 23 01:15:40 1996  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@mit.edu>

	* configure.in, Makefile.in: Check to see if the -lgen library
		exists; if so, add it to the SHLIB_LIBS line, since it
		will be needed by an_to_ln.c, in all probability.

Fri Jun  7 17:38:09 1996  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in (all-windows, clean-windows): Use full directory
		name "error_tables" when building under Windows so that
		the build will work correctly under VFAT and NTFS filesystems.

Thu Jun  6 00:04:38 1996  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in (all-windows): Don't pass $(LIBCMD) on the command
		line.  It's set in the windows.in prologue for all Makefiles anyway.

Mon May 20 10:56:51 1996  Tom Yu  <tlyu@dragons-lair.MIT.EDU>

	* Makefile.in (libkrb5.$(STEXT)): fix sense of test; also deal
		with new improved libupdate

Tue Apr 30 16:31:50 1996  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@cygnus.com>

	* Makefile.in (libkrb5.$(STEXT)): Set a variable with or without
	"--force" and use it, instead of duplicating the rest of the
	code.  Use LIBDONE as list to process, so berk_db will be skipped
	when not in use.  Check exit status of LIBUPDATE invocation.
	Remove library before creating as workaround for libupdate bug.

Wed Feb  7 00:23:18 1996  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* Makefile.in: Folded in danw's changes to allow
		building Makefiles for the Macintosh.  We now can build
		MPW makefiles which are interpreted by CodeWarrior.

Sat Jan 27 18:25:42 1996  Sam Hartman  <hartmans@tertius.mit.edu>

	* configure.in (hashloc): Fix quoting so it makes it into the Makefile.

Mon Jan 22 15:23:05 1996  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

	* configure.in: Merge in berk_db library if needed.

	* Makefile.in (LIB_SUBDIRS): Get location of berk_db from
		configure if needed.

Wed Dec 13 07:09:30 1995  Chris Provenzano (proven@mit.edu)

        * Makefile.in : Move db keytab routines to lib/kdb.

Tue Dec  5 20:57:06 1995  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Removed dependency on krb4 library in building
		shared library. 

Fri Nov  3 21:31:44 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* Makefile.in: Added the ccache/memory subdirectory.

Fri Oct  6 22:05:44 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* Makefile.in: Remove ##DOS!include of config/windows.in.
		config/windows.in is now included by wconfig.

Mon Oct  2 11:12:24 1995  Ezra Peisach  <epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu>

	* configure.in (V5_MAKE_SHARED_LIB): Change rule to install
		version 0.1 of the library. Pass the libcrypto and
		libcom_err version number to Makefile

	* Makefile.in (CRYPTO_VER): Get the proper libcrypto version number

Mon Sep 25 17:01:48 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* Makefile.in: Removed "foo:: foo-$(WHAT)" lines from the
		Makefile. 

Wed Sep 13 11:11:38 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* Makefile.in: Put back in all:: all-$(WHAT) rule--PC needs it.

Fri Jun 30 14:43:38 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* Makefile.in - Add Berkeley database code here.  Remove typo in
		libupdate section.

Wed Jun 28 21:25:29 1995  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* configure.in: with static libs, we need install-unix, not install.

Mon Jun 26 17:36:53 1995  Sam Hartman  <hartmans@tardis.MIT.EDU>

	* Makefile.in (install-unix): This should be generated by configure.in, not Makefile.in.  My typo was there, not here.

Sun Jun 25 08:24:46 1995  Tom Yu  (tlyu@dragons-lair)

	* Makefile.in: Typo: install-mac was really supposed to be
		install-unix

Fri Jun 23 12:15:02 1995  Sam Hartman  <hartmans@tardis.MIT.EDU>

	* configure.in: Typo: krb5_cv_staticlibs_enabled, not
        krb5_cv_enable_staticlibs

Thu Jun 22 18:03:35 1995  Sam Hartman  (hartmans@tardis)

	* Makefile.in: Treat libcom_err.a as shared, use new conventions
	regarding static version.


Fri Jun 16 11:16:44 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* configure.in - Add shared library install target.


Thu Jun 15 18:08:12 EDT 1995	Paul Park	(pjpark@mit.edu)
	* Makefile.in - Add definitions for shared library build rules.  Also,
		remove explicit "all" target at front so we do subdirectories
		first.
	* configure.in - Create symlinks for archive and shared library when
		we build them.

Fri Jun  9 18:51:24 1995    <tytso@rsx-11.mit.edu>

	* configure.in: Remove standardized set of autoconf macros, which
		are now handled by CONFIG_RULES.  Use DO_SUBDIRS to
		recurse down subdirectories.

Fri May 26 20:12:37 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* configure.in, Makefile.in: Add support for building shared libraries.

Sat Apr 22 10:58:49 1995  Ezra Peisach  (epeisach@kangaroo.mit.edu)

	* configure.in: Add rule for make check to descend to subdirs

Fri Apr 21 20:47:35 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* Makefile.in: Added the profile directory for the profile routines.

Wed Mar 15 20:23:17 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

	* Makefile.in: cleaned up for the PC

Wed Mar 15 12:26:21 1995 Keith Vetter (keithv@fusion.com)

Wed Nov  2 02:35:44 1994  Mark W. Eichin  (eichin@paycheck.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in (libkrb5.a): done needs a trailing semicolon if it
	isn't followed by a newline, as does fi, with certain shells.

Tue Nov  1 14:56:47 1994    (tytso@rsx-11)

	* Makefile.in: Change the way libupdate works so that we use
		libkrb5.stamp to determine whether or not $arcmd needs to
		be rerun. 

	* Makefile.in:
	* configure.in: Change the way the library is built to use the
		libupdate script.
