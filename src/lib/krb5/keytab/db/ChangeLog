1999-10-26  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Clean up usage of CFLAGS, CPPFLAGS, DEFS, DEFINES,
	LOCAL_INCLUDES such that one can override CFLAGS from the command
	line without losing CPP search patchs and defines. Some associated
	Makefile cleanup. [from wsanchez@apple.com]

1998-11-13  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@rsts-11.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Set the myfulldir and mydir variables (which are
		relative to buildtop and thisconfigdir, respectively.)

Fri Feb 27 18:03:33 1998  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@rsts-11.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Changed thisconfigdir to point at the lib/krb5
 		directory, since we've moved all of the configure.in
		tests to the toplevel lib/krb5 configure.in

Wed Feb 18 16:23:03 1998  Tom Yu  <tlyu@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Remove trailing slash from thisconfigdir.  Fix up
	BUILDTOP for new conventions.

Mon Feb  2 17:02:29 1998  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@rsts-11.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Define BUILDTOP and thisconfigdir in the Makefile

Mon Feb  2 17:05:10 1998  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@rsts-11.mit.edu>

	* configure.in: Remove SubDirLibrary rules (we will need to fix
		this directory when we decide to build it again.)

	* Makefile.in: Define BUILDTOP and thisconfigdir in the Makefile
